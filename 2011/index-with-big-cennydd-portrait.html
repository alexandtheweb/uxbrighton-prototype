		<p class="first">The UX Brighton team are proud to be presenting a User Experience Conference at Brighton Dome’s Corn Exchange.</p>
		<p>Whether you’re new to the field or you’re an industry professional, UX Brighton 2011 is an opportunity to debate, cogitate and learn about User Experience through the lense of various disciplines stretching from anthropology to cross-channel design.</p>
		<p>Blending provocative thinkers and seasoned professionals from the UK and Europe with  speakers from Brighton’s renowned UX community, we’re here to look at how User Experience design is changing with the times.</p>
		<p>This is our second event, after last year’s success at UX Brighton 2010.</p>
	
	<div id="testimonials">
		<h2>Reviews of 2010</h2>
		<p>The very first UX Brighton last September was an incredible event that brought together a lot of talented people. The audience was engaged, informed, and entertaining. Rarely have I had so much fun talking to conference participants and I learned a lot, too. Brighton is a helluva cool town! This could well become one of the top three events in the UK - so get your ticket NOW!</p>
		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Eric Reiss</span>, Speaker at UX Brighton 2010, CEO, The FatDux Group</h3>
		
		<p>UX Brighton has been a great experience. It's an intimate conference with a great audience and atmosphere. I loved speaking there and felt honored to be amongst a superb selection of speakers.</p>
		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Jeroen van Geel</span>, Speaker at UX Brighton 2010, Founder &amp; CEO, Johnny Holland</h3>
		
		<p>I found the conference an interesting mix of research and UX driven inspiration. Outside of the interesting subject matter presentations, my key take-out (as an MD of a design and innovation consultancy) was the energy that is currently powering Interaction Design forward and the positive approach to both the discipline and the market place. I will be there again this year. Looking forward to it.</p>
		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Matt Pattison</span>, Director and co-founder of 7bn, Insight & Strategy</h3>
		
		<p>Really enjoyed the day and the wide range of topics covered. Since then I've snuck in plenty of facts from the talks into client meetings and it's helped to improve my UX skills. Ace.</p>
		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Ali Pettit</span>, Senior Account Manager, Public Life</h3>
		
		<p>The UX Brighton conference has managed, in its first year, to put together a group of speakers worthy of a much higher ticket price. The atmosphere created was entertaining and exciting to be in. I look forward to the next one.</p>

		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Al Power</span>, Web Development Lead, Nominet UK</h3>
		
		<p>This was my first UX event and will definitely not be my last. I took away plenty of tips that I can apply to web writing, as well as an improved understanding of how my audience thinks and interacts with web pages.</p>
		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Helen Keevy</span>, Core Copywriting</h3>
		
		<p>The first UX Brighton was insightful with some great speakers who raised interesting arguments. I look forward to seeing what the next conference has to offer.</p>
		<h3><span class='reviewer'>Elly Boulboul</span>, Graphic Designer, Strawberry Soup</h3>
		
		<p>I found UX Brighton 2010 to be entertaining and informative - a good combination in my book. UX Brighton is important in championing the needs of users, something often overlooked, yet central to the success of products we make.</p>

<h2>Speakers</h2>
<h3 id='speaker1' class='schedule-tba'><!-- <abbr title="2011-09-13T09:00:00">09.00</abbr> --> Robin Dunbar</h3>
<strong>The talk</strong>
<p><b>Connecting anthropology and User Experience: What can we learn from the study of social behaviour and how groups function most effectively?</b></p>
<p>Professor Robin Dunbar is a British anthropologist who specialises in the evolution of sociality. His work is fundamental to User Experience design and the implications of his findings are vast when it comes to designing social spaces.</p>
<strong>What’s he known for?</strong>
<p>Robin is best known for formulating Dunbar's number which can be defined as:
“ The measurement of the cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships." He theorized that this was a limit of 150 individuals. The implications of this for User Experience design are vast when it comes to designing social spaces and creating communities.</p>
<p>His principle research areas also include the behavioural ecology of social decision-making, modelling socio-ecological systems and their evolution, the structure and dynamics of social networks, and the nature of social bonding.</p>
<strong>The credentials</strong>
<p>He is currently Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology and the Director of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology of the University of Oxford and the Co-director of the British Academy Centenary Research Project.</p>


<h3 id='speaker2' class='schedule-tba'><!-- <abbr title="2011-09-13T09:00:00">09.00</abbr> --> Andrea Resmini</h3>
<strong>The talk</strong>
<p><b>Designing cross-channel user experiences</b></p>
<p>50 years ago we relied on books and people for information, then we gradually started going to our desktop computers to look things up, now we've got iPads and other restless, smaller, faster physical devices.</p>
<p>Information is bleeding out of the Internet and becoming ever more embedded in the real world. The boundaries are blurring between the physical and the digital.</p>
<p>Our experiences travel across channels: we check something out on the web, we get texts, we go to the shop, we bring the thing home, we connect it, we get more services online. Shouldn't our design vision reflect this behaviour too?</p>
<strong>What’s he known for?</strong>
<p>Andrea Resmini is President of the Information Architecture Institute, he chairs the Italian IA Summit, is a founding member of the European center for user experience, and finally is one of the founders and now an Associate Editor for the Journal of Information Architecture.</p>
<strong>The credentials</strong>
<p>Andrea has been working as an ICT professional since 1989. He holds an MA in Architecture and Industrial Design and a PhD in Legal Informatics and IT Law. He’s now working at the University of Borâs, Sweden, researching and teaching IA- and UX-related courses while still hoisting the IA flag at FatDUX, a leading UX firm based in Copenhagen with offices all over Europe, the US and Canada.</p>

<h3 id='speaker3' class='schedule-tba'><!-- <abbr title="2011-09-13T09:00:00">09.00</abbr> --> Hubert Anyżewski</h3>
<strong>The talk</strong>
<p><b>Which way forward? Replacing paper exams with simulations.</b></p>
<p>Hubert Anyzewski is experimenting with replacing paper tests with simulations and games.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a paper test that was used in Poland to test children's attitudes to different careers. Now, with this pilot experiment, he's replaced the test with a 3D computer game. Hubert shares his findings and gives us food for thought on the question of whether computer games and simulation could ever realistically replace the written test.</p>
<strong>What’s he known for?</strong>
<p>Hubert is a Human-Computer Interaction Researcher, AI Designer, Usability Researcher and Interface Designer.</p>
<p>He is one of the most experienced usability and UX design specialists in Poland and a has been a leading light in UX design there since 2002.

<strong>The talk</strong>
<p><b>Designing the wider web</b></p>
<p>The dominance of the desktop browser is over. The web is wider now. It’s time to move away from ‘device specific thinking’ and time to transcend ‘platformism’. Now we’re designing for contexts, displays, connectivity, and inputs by breaking devices down into first principles. Designers should now be aiming to create great user experiences using the truly fluid nature of the web.</p>
