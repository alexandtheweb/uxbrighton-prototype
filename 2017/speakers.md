### Useful information
#### Presentations

- You can embed audio within your slides if necessary.
- Preferred format for your slides is 16:9 (widescreen).
- There will be a lectern to present from but you will have a wireless lapel mic so you are free to roam the stage if you want to.
- We don't require your decks beforehand, however we do like to make them available to delegates after the event.
#### Travel & hotel
- We recommend that you travel to Brighton by public transport as parking is notoriously hard to come by, and there is no parking at the venue. 
- If you are driving, the nearest NCP carpark is Brighton Theatre on Church Street: https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/brighton-theatre/
- Standard travel costs are reimbursed after the event, on production of receipts.
- We book you a double room, including breakfast, on Thursday night at a central hotel in Brighton. 
#### Speaker meal & lunch
- We arrange a meal for all speakers on Thursday evening. In previous years we've had a Michelin starred chef cook for us at a private dining space, close to the hotel. 
- On conference day, we invite all speakers to attend the whole day if possible. We also take you out for lunch at a restaurant close to the venue.
