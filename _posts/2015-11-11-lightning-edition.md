Inspired by the great work from 300 Seconds, we’re hosting a special lightning event and we would like you to join us and take part!

The Brighton UX Community is full of talented individuals. We’ve always encouraged sharing your experiences and learning and always want to hear from the community, whether you’ve started your career, or consider yourself a seasoned pro. At this event, we’ll be sharing with each other with a series of rapid 5 minute talks - and anybody can speak.
The Format
Whether you’ve spoken before in public or not, we’d like you to give it a go. The night will have no more than 10 people with a few breaks in between for refreshments and snacks in good supply.

There are no subjects too big or too small, we are a wonderfully diverse community of people with varying levels of experience. If you’ve only just started your career, or you’re long in the tooth - this is a great time to give it a go, whether you want to share how to manage a backlog, run a user test or highlight the many, many flaws in video game UI - everything is welcome.
I’d like to speak
Would you? That’s great! Send your presentation idea to andy.parker@clearleft.com and we’ll talk about it together.

Your talk must be no more than 5 minutes long (it is timed) and it is entirely up to you whether you want to use slides but, they have to be static. Subject matter can be anything you like but must not be a sales pitch for your company or product (unless it is a side-project).
