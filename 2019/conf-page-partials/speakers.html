          <p>We are entering the age of intelligence—a time when technologists imbue artificially intelligent components into many products without a clear framework for how such intelligence is delivered to users consistently. It is a product designer’s job to make AI feel human-like and magical, not overwhelming and scary to users. When designing for Artificial Intelligence scenarios, whether for a large enterprise or small startup, setting user expectations is critical to deliver a reliable product. Emily will share some best practices from designing for AI in both large and small organizations. No matter the company size, a minimum viable product is important to design and not to be the result of unplanned feature cuts. Emily will share what Minimum Viable Intelligence is for an AI product, and how designers can deliver a clear UX when solving problems efficiently.</p>

          <p>When thinking of how to design for intelligent products, first and foremost it needs to seem competent. Users must trust the AI agent or service with information and believe that it can achieve their goal. The bar for this depends on the expectations the designer sets. The most difficult thing about breaking out of scenario-focused AI is the lack of clear boundaries. Are you aspiring to create an entire conversational AI agent? Then the bar will be high. A less intelligent Bot, however, will teach users the rails of its conversation early on to avoid disappointment. In this talk we’ll dig deeper into setting appropriate expectations when designing for AI across large and small applications.</p>

          <p>Emily will share how drawing on human interaction models helps designers know what to expect when people encounter their AI product. Responsiveness when users expect it is only one part of this equation. Apps that explain processes in human ways, like thinking, seeing, or reading, can benefit from showing users where they are in a process, while explaining it in natural ways. Emulating true intelligence takes more than just seeming alive and being basically competent though. To surpass users’ expectations can be a delightful moment when the product seems truly and independently intelligent.</p>

          <p>This talk really recognises how young UX Design (as a discipline) is when compared to other design disciplines and asks ourselves to make the effort to learn more about the history of branding, publishing, advertising, industrial design, type design etc to see what we can learn and take forward with us.</p>

          <p>Teams iterating without a vision are working blindfolded. The constant demand for new features and growth often force product teams into endless cycles of iteration. At best, they're missing out on new opportunities. At worst, they’re ignoring threats that could upend their business.</p>
          <p>The struggle to plan beyond the short-term mean it's easy to ignore the future bets you need to make to survive.</p>
          <p>In this talk, Brendan will share models and ways of working from that designers and product owners can use to focus on both the short and long term.</p>
          <p>Some of the topics covered in this talk are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the value of a vision,</li>

          <p>Inclusive design is a noble and aspirational concept; however it can be challenging to implement as a process and can seem inaccessible to client projects.</p>
          <p>Including the extremes, while keeping an eye on your core audience can seem like a daunting and expensive approach. What if we told you that there is a shortcut to inclusive design?
