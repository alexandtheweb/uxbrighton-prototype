          talk-time: 10:00 am
          talk-title: Old thinking
          talk-summary: >-
            Holding the mirror up to some of the â€˜new thinkingâ€™ in design and
            showing that it is the same as the ideas being explored way back in
            other design disciplines.


            This talk really recognises how young UX Design (as a discipline) is when compared to other design disciplines and asks ourselves to make the effort to learn more about the history of branding, publishing, advertising, industrial design, type design etc to see what we can learn and take forward with us.
