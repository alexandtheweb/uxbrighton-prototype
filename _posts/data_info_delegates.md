# Delegates
## How our audience data can help you decide if UX Brighton is for you
 
To give you a concise overview of our previous attendees, we’ve crunched the data from our past conferences.
 
We've been running an annual conference for six years, attracting a savvy and diverse crowd from a range of backgrounds. From UX students, practitioners, project and product people to CEO's and founders; you'll be able to network, talk to industry professionals, check out sponsor products and even look for a job.
 
Our events are informal yet professional and we're pleased to welcome new faces alongside seasoned regulars.
