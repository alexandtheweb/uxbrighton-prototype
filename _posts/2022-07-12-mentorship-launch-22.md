In a recent survey (https://uxdesign.cc/ux-research-characteristics-an-analysis-of-100-open-jobs-36f0a7b77bac) looking at 100 Experience Researcher job postings in the US in 2021, it was found that collaboration (84%) and business acumen(scoping, translating business requirements, & influencing product strategy) was the most sought after requirements, other than the expected requirements of designing and conducting research studies (84%) for a UX Researcher. Also, it is no secret that there is now more demand for user insights than there are UX researchers in the industry. This talk highlights the emerging demands of the industry from a UX Research role, elucidates why a change in perspective is required to meet these demands & how one could benefit from this perspective shift to grow into an experienced researcher: amplifying the impact of UX research and leveraging research soft-skills of collaboration, communication, connection, and influence to empower product teams & stakeholders.
