About UX Brighton
Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks around a single theme.

This year’s theme is Advancing Research.

Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.
A boutique team
UX Brighton is carefully curated by Danny Hope, a UX consultant with over a decade of experience. Conference Producer Emmeline Caines-Gooby ensures the conference runs like a smoothly oiled machine. They’ve been working together since 2011. Danny and Emm are backed up by a team of volunteers who all work to ensure the conference is a great day for all our attendees, speakers and sponsors.

If you’re interested in sponsoring, please either email emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk or DM @uxbri (DMs are open).
Unique venue
The Brighton Dome is part of the historical and beautiful Pavilion estate, home to Prince George, the Prince Regent. Originally his riding school and stables, the Concert Hall is a stunning 1200 seated theatre. We’ve been holding our conference here since 2011 and love it’s unique brand of Brighton quirkiness.

Why sponsor us?
Brand visibility, networking, hiring and showing your commitment to the UX community
Our delegates want to hear from companies that support us. They are looking for new jobs, resources and tools. The UX community will share their knowledge so that those who support us will continue to receive the benefit long after. As you might expect, we’re a creative bunch, so encourage our sponsors to think beyond the exhibition stand.

Other opportunities
We’ve got lots of ideas, and welcome your suggestions too - we’re more than happy to tailor a package to suit your needs.
FUN - Entertainment during the breaks in a day full of cerebral, mind expanding talks can be a great way to engage our delegates. Maybe sponsor a Photobooth.
USEFUL GIVEAWAYS - Quality items such as branded Post-Its, Sharpies, notebooks, re-usable aluminium water bottles or coffee cups. Items that delegates want and use long after the conference.
DAYTIME TREATS - Enhance the experience by sponsoring fruit, pastries and coffee throughout the day. Or how about an on site barista or smoothie bar?
FLASH YOUR LOGO - Lanyards around the neck of every delegate & speaker, volunteer t-shirts, a charging station.
POST CONFERENCE DRINKS - Everyone loves the chance to network and discuss the day once the conference wraps, what better way than to sponsor the post conference drinks?!

If you’re interested in sponsoring, please either email emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk or DM @uxbri (DMs are open).
