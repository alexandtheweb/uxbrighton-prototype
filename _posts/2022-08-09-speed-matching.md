Join us for an evening of mentor/ee speed matching. Whether you’re a UXer of many years’ standing, new to UX or UX is only part of what you do, so much the better. A mix of skills and backgrounds enriches the community.   You can choose to be a mentor or mentee or you can sign up to be both!

### **How does the Speed Matching work?**

* Get your ticket 
* Attend the Speed Matching evening with a goal in mind that you would like to achieve from working with a mentor/ee by April 2023. 
* You'll have 5 minute chats, in true speed matching style, with other ambitious UXers wanting to pair up. You could have a specific question in mind related to your goal but also think about what you can offer as a mentor! 
* Rate your connections on your speed matching score card and hand it in. 
* After the event our matching team will study your score cards and endevour to pair everyone up.* 
* We'll be in touch with what we hope will be your perfect mentor/ee match. 

### **What happens after we've been paired up?** 

*

\*Please note that we will do our best to ensure everyone gets a match but we can't make any promises.
