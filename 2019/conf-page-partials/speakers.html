          <p>We are entering the age of intelligence—a time when technologists imbue artificially intelligent components into many products without a clear framework for how such intelligence is delivered to users consistently. It is a product designer’s job to make AI feel human-like and magical, not overwhelming and scary to users. When designing for Artificial Intelligence scenarios, whether for a large enterprise or small startup, setting user expectations is critical to deliver a reliable product. Emily will share some best practices from designing for AI in both large and small organizations. No matter the company size, a minimum viable product is important to design and not to be the result of unplanned feature cuts. Emily will share what Minimum Viable Intelligence is for an AI product, and how designers can deliver a clear UX when solving problems efficiently.</p>

          <p>When thinking of how to design for intelligent products, first and foremost it needs to seem competent. Users must trust the AI agent or service with information and believe that it can achieve their goal. The bar for this depends on the expectations the designer sets. The most difficult thing about breaking out of scenario-focused AI is the lack of clear boundaries. Are you aspiring to create an entire conversational AI agent? Then the bar will be high. A less intelligent Bot, however, will teach users the rails of its conversation early on to avoid disappointment. In this talk we’ll dig deeper into setting appropriate expectations when designing for AI across large and small applications.</p>

          <p>Emily will share how drawing on human interaction models helps designers know what to expect when people encounter their AI product. Responsiveness when users expect it is only one part of this equation. Apps that explain processes in human ways, like thinking, seeing, or reading, can benefit from showing users where they are in a process, while explaining it in natural ways. Emulating true intelligence takes more than just seeming alive and being basically competent though. To surpass users’ expectations can be a delightful moment when the product seems truly and independently intelligent.</p>

          <p>Teams iterating without a vision are working blindfolded. The constant demand for new features and growth often force product teams into endless cycles of iteration. At best, they're missing out on new opportunities. At worst, they’re ignoring threats that could upend their business.</p>
          <p>The struggle to plan beyond the short-term mean it's easy to ignore the future bets you need to make to survive.</p>

          <p>The world of UX Design is constantly in flux, and there are so many different approaches - some good, some not so good. UX Design is inherently art and science, but since the explosion in popularity of UX, the science component of UX Design has lost out to the more appealing visual design elements of the practice.</p>
          <p>In his talk, <em>Scientific Design</em>, Nick will show you where you can add science to your workflow to help guide your craft and to enhance your creativity, rather than to limit and stifle it. We'll cover methods for both innovation-type projects and optimisation-type projects, as well as how to apply scientific principles alongside all that you do. Adding science to design creates killer UX, and Nick will give you all the shortcuts and pointers needed to apply scientific design on the project you're currently working on.</p>

          <p>Design Thinking is a powerful mindset and framework leading to innovation and bringing to market impactful products/services. However, after the initial excitement applying it within different business environments, criticism started to emerge putting into question its value.</p>
          <p>This talk aims to present what makes Design Thinking a powerful tool and the type of problems is good for.</p>
          <p>Based on Carmen's experience working with many product teams, she will be covering the main practices diluting the Design Thinking value, and a direction to avoid ending up in disappointment.</p>
          <p>Like Agile and Lean, Design Thinking has its place. None of them are silver bullets. It doesn't exist a formula we can apply to solve everything in the same way. Different problems require different/flexible approaches to solve them.</p>

          <p>Life is full of surprises; some are good and some are not so good. Our ability to stay flexible and positive under pressure can have a huge impact on our wellbeing. Resilience is not an innate capability; it's more like a muscle that can be built and strengthened. There are 4 pillars to well being: mental, physical, emotional and social. Each of these can be fortified to help us handle life's ups and downs, reducing the negative impact and allowing you to take it in your stride. In this session, we will talk about a few research-backed techniques that can help you bounce back when you need to.</p>
