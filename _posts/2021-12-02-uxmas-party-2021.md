## UXmas Party 2021!

### Thursday 2 December ðŸŽ„

Weâ€™ve teamed up with the fabulous folks at [UXup](https://twitter.com/UXup_Brighton) and [UXcamp Brighton](https://www.uxcampbrighton.org/) to bring you a very merry and very UX-y Christmas knees-up extravaganza.

It's a simple concept: a sociable bunch ofÂ UXÂ pros turn up at aÂ BrightonÂ pub to catch up, make merry, toast the festive season and look forwardÂ to a busy 2022. There are no tickets - justÂ turn up and enjoy yourselves. Wear what you like. If you're hungry, theÂ NelsonÂ does decent food.
