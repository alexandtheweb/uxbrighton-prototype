__Measuring the Customer Experience with Top Tasks - a masterclass with Gerry McGovern__

We’re delighted to welcome Gerry McGovern back to Brighton after his very popular talk at last year’s UX Brighton conference. Gerry will be running a hands-on practical workshop on how to use the Top Tasks Identification method.

*Gerry McGovern’s Top Tasks methods have been used by organizations such as Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, Google, the European Union, Canadian Government, and hundreds of others.*

## What you'll learn

If you’re designing or managing a website or app, how do you know what really matters to your customers? How do you know what really doesn’t matter? Once you’ve identified what really matters, how do you ensure that these top tasks are easy to find? How do you ensure that they are easy to do? As you change your website or app, how do you know the customer experience is getting better? How do you develop customer experience metrics that can convince management you’re doing a good job?

Gerry McGovern’s Top Tasks masterclass will answer these questions and a lot more. You will learn how to clinically and objectively observe customer behavior so as to derive management metrics. To truly understand what’s working and what isn’t—and how to make things better. Top Tasks gives you compelling evidence to present to management and peers to show that the work you are doing is improving the customer experience.

## Activities

Places are limited to just 15 attendees in order to enable a highly interactive focussed workshop where during the day you will:

1. Plan for a JTBD Research Project
2. Define their audiences
3. Write JTBD scripts
4. Write JTBD stories
