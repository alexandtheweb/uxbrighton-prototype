          talk-title: Leading culture change to increase customer centricity
          talk-summary: >-
            Digital disruptors and the covid crisis have highlighted the
            importance of customer centricity. Business leaders clearly
            recognise their organisations need to be more customer centric and
            future proof them against ever-changing customer expectations,
            volatile economic conditions and aggressive digital disruptors.\

            Business leaders want to understand how to lead culture change to be more customer centric, how to implement new ways of working and how technology can enable their strategy.\

            Jonathan will talk about leading culture change to increase customer centricity, innovation and agility:


            * Working backwards from customers

            * Implications for operating models to empower small cross-functional teams.

            * How companies like Amazon, Cisco and others reinforce and change their culture.


            Jonathan’s objective is to help leaders understand their critical role increasing the focus on customer centricity.
