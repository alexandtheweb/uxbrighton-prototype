The next UX Brighton event is our Xmas party. Weâ€™ll order takeaway curry and BYO booze, then around 9pm go off to a nearby pub.

This is an unticketed event, please just <a href="https://twitter.com/uxbri">tweet on the day</a> to let us know that you're coming.

A festive co-production with <a href="https://twitter.com/uxcurrybrighton">UX Curry Brighton</a>.
