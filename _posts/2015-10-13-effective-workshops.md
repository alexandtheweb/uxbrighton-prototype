## About the workshop

Workshops are a great way of getting working with clients, your own design team, or even your users. Workshops provide a way to come up with great ideas for a project whether running them at the ‘kick-off’ stage of a project or trying to solve a particular design challenge.

Learn tips and techniques from Alison Coward, founder of Bracket. Alison gave a talk on her [top 10 tips for running great workshops](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/people-skills-for-uxers/ "") for UX Brighton in February and we’ve invited her to to run a full-day session to share the same methods she uses to get great results with her clients such as Barclays, Etsy, Channel 4 and Trendwatching.

**Workshops are becoming the heart of design, innovation and strategy projects.  You need to bring people together - your clients, your colleagues, users - to gather information, generate ideas and identify the best solutions.**

The people you invite have limited time (and patience) and it’s your job to make it a productive session for everyone, whilst at the same time getting the rich and useful content you need to move the project forward. 

If you’ve ever been part of a great workshop, you might think the facilitator worked some kind of magic. But it’s not a mystical talent that some people have and some don’t - it’s a skill that can be learned and developed like any other.

This interactive and practical one-day training is perfect for complete beginners, or people who have been ‘muddling’ along and want to brush up their skills. You’ll build your confidence and come away with tips, tricks and techniques to run your next workshop with ease. We’re limiting the number of places to ensure that the course is intimate and you can get your questions answered.

We’ll cover things like:

- the best place to start if you’ve never facilitated a workshop before, and how to run a great workshop even if you’re nervous about presenting
- where you should focus your energy and time for the best sessions
- making sure you get contributions from all personality types - junior and senior staff, introverts and extroverts
- developing your own facilitation style
- the ‘hidden’ factors that can get in the way of your workshop facilitation efforts

We’ll look at how to design workshops that get results and concrete outcomes, group dynamics to look out for, tips for better brainstorming, facilitation techniques, methods that support and encourage creativity and how to keep momentum going after the workshop.
By the end of the session you’ll be able to:

- design and plan great workshops for different needs
- deal with the common challenges that come up during workshops
- lead great and effective brainstorming and ideation sessions
- make sure everyone stays motivated and engaged, and you get valuable contributions from everyone in the room
- run highly creative (and fun) sessions whilst still making sure things get done

If you have questions please feel free to email [luke@lukehay.co.uk](mailto:luke@lukehay.co.uk ""). If there are specific things you’d like to see covered in the workshop, we’d love to hear about those too.
