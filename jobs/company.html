    <h2>Senior UX Researcher, City of  London</h2>
    <p>We’re on the lookout for empathetic design-thinkers to help us deliver the best banking experience possible. </p>
    <p>The team is growing fast with no sign of slowing down, so we're hiring for multiple roles. </p>
    <p>We’re building a bank for and with our users. A product that’s fair, transparent and a pleasure to use. As we pave the way for the future of banking, we need a deeper understanding the problems we want to solve and how we solve them. </p>
    <p>That’s where you come in. </p>

    <h2>Ready to help over a million people every day?</h2>
    <p>You’ll be working on a product that is a part of day to day life for more than a million people already, and your work here will shape the way that people interact with their finances. </p>
    <p>We work closely with Product Managers and Product Designers to generate insight to fuel ideas and then evaluate design solutions. </p>
    <p>We’re quick to adopt better tools and processes, so you’ll be more than welcome to contribute all the good practices you’ve used before.</p>

    <h2>You should apply if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You’ve got lots of hands-on experience with exploratory and evaluative qualitative research methods, appreciating their limitations and when to apply them appropriately. </li>
      <li>You can independently run research projects, from planning, scoping, running the sessions, analysing and creating deliverables. </li>
      <li>You can run user testing with your eyes closed, regardless of the setting. You should be comfortable in a lab as well as stopping people in the street for quick feedback or setting up remote tests. </li>
      <li>You’re happy user testing on mobile. We’re a mobile-only bank, so if you’ve got experience with both iOS and Android we’ll love you even more.</li>
