**We've developed an amazing set of skills for empathising with our end-users, but rarely if ever do we turn these techniques in the other direction: on our clients. Just the opposite in fact: we're much more likely to talk of our clients as idiots who don't 'get it' than as understandably stressed human beings pushed outside of their comfort zone.**

**This lack of empathy seems strange given our trade, and the fact that they have by far the most influence over whether our not our projects will be successful.**

**If we can learn to handle our stakeholders more empathetically then we can make better products for our users, and help our projects to run smoothly and successfully.**

**And that's what this event is all about.** 

Speaker details are below. More details on the each talk will be added soon.
