## UX Camp Redux

Back in March 2017, our friends UX Camp Brighton held their most popular barcamp yet. In keeping with tradition, here at UX Brighton we’re extremely happy to host the follow-up Redux event featuring some of the most popular sessions from the day. 

UX Camp Brigton is an ‘unconference’ for anyone involved or interested in user experience design, user research, interaction design, information architecture, usability, accessibility and other associated fields.

Attendees either ran or participated in 20 minute sessions, such as talks, demos or discussions. No headliners, no product pitches, just a friendly (if intense) event focused on sharing, socialising and learning new stuff.

This event brings together four diverse and informative sessions from the day to give a flavour of what made the day a huge success.

## Speakers

The speakers for this session are:
<ul>
<li>Rebecca Hugo - Purposeful Page Architecture</li>
<li>Peter Winchester - The London Underground. Your 100 year old guide to website navigation</li>
<li>Kathy Neuss - The researchers' responsibilities</li>
<li>John Flitcroft - Talk title TBC</li>
</ul>
