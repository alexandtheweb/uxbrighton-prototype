				<h4>War Stories: How war affects the ethics of user research</h4>
				<p><strong>User Experience professionals (UX) tend to come from a diverse field of occupations and have very different life experiences. Those who join with a background in psychology come with a perhaps unique skill set. Amongst these skills will include memories of experimental design, statistics and ethics classes. This talk will discuss why international protocols exist in this domain that control when, where, and how you use the phrase – “could you test this for me?”, and you subsequently collect opinions, views, and performance data about that person’s experience.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>The talk will use examples from psychological research into safety and security products and systems. The aim is for UX people to understand their roles and responsibilities in dealing with those that participate in experiments and what 'informed consent' truly might be, and how you should protect to psychological wellbeing of the person telling you – “I love your product”</strong></p>

			<p>He founded the human factors group at the University of Sussex, which successfully transferred into the science park, 10 years ago, to become User Perspective ltd. Now the UK’s leading human factors group for transport and security.</p>			
			<p>User Perspective has completed almost 500 projects and investigations to date. Notable work has included: time in Paris for Lord Steven’s Operation Paget, where the team investigated driver error and eye witness reliability; the creation (for HM Government) of guides, training and assessment tools for security control rooms; for international organisations and friendly governments, the enhancement of security screening methods at airports.</p>
			<p>The group works across many government departments and FTSE100 companies. Work encompasses rail, marine, road, and aviation markets</p>
			<p>Martin maintains his knowledge by acting as a government auditor for research funding bodies, lecturing at several universities – including The Royal College of Art, and is ethics and technical advisor / reviewer to many organisations and scientific journals.</p>

				<h4>Reasonable Progress</h4>
				<p><strong>From the draughtsman’s table to the boardroom, the role of design has been moving from decoration to the delivery of strategic advantage.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>This shift can be described with concepts from the world of philosophy and the history of natural sciences, particularly the three models of reasoning: deduction, induction and abduction.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Andy will discuss how we can help organisations become more resilient and sustainable; to help them not just to survive but thrive in increasingly complex situations.</strong></p>

				<h4>Design is a statement of value: From Hume to Home</h4>
				<p><strong>Like many things we take for granted, the concepts of evidence and science emerged before our time. But where do these ideas come from? What came before? What does it mean to be empirical, and what can designers learn from one of its founding fathers, the radical sceptic David Hume?

				<h4>Socio-history & design</h4>
				<p><strong>With the rise of lean everything and the obsession with neuroscience and behavioural psychology, it’s good to do a few steps back and remind ourselves that design is not about providing artefacts for a mass psychological experiment to extract money from users. Design is part of a rich mix of history and society, of hopes, desires and inspirations. When done well, it can provide new opportunities for creating tools to express and shape who we are.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>If we follow the headlines of Fast Company or check the titles of recent books we are made to believe that there is no other truth than scientific truth. Design cannot be good unless it follows the path of science, a set of research experiments that prove the wrong and the right ways for people to interact with our products. Yet when we investigate deeper, most of our desires do not come from a basic set of needs but from a complex social-historical set of ideas about how the world should be and how lives should be led.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>The life, work and writings of architect Louis Kahn – a contemporary of Le Corbusier and van der Rohe and currently celebrated with an exhibition in London’s Design Museum– form an engaging story of someone who managed to combine a philosophy of design and architecture and a deep understanding of history and culture into a body of work that won him the nickname of the architect’s philosopher.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>There are many similarities between the way Kahn, Jony Ive and Dieter Rams speak about design, but where Rams has ten short commandments and Ive is mainly known from soundbites, Kahn’s ideas —formed during 40 years of teaching, speaking and writing— make for a well-rounded, deeply thought-through philosophy. In my talk he will show how this philosophical and practical framework can challenge our current notion of design and allow us to see a wider role of design in the world.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>After decades of adherence to the Modernists’ rallying cry ‘form follows function’, Kahn undermined the simplicity of this idea. He showed that taking into account the complexity of feelings and ideas as well as their social and historical context gives you the ability to create richer, more complex and engaging work.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Kahn’s philosophy guided his work. He took the clients’ briefs and transformed the projects into examples of a different way of living and thinking about the world. This personal vision —one that we can also find in the work of Dieter Rams or Wim Crouwel, or even in Writer Pro by Oliver Reichenstein— allows designers to go beyond a reactionary attitude and take design and architecture further than what is currently thought possible.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Understanding Kahn’s ideas and philosophy opens a new way of thinking about design in the digital era. It enables us to find a place for design beyond the narrow focus of business and to start asking questions about its cultural and social role. By going outside the short-term concerns of companies we can expand and create more value for business and people alike.</strong></p>

				<h4>How-To Generate Software Designs from Philosophy</h4>

				<p><strong>A familiar situation for designers is where the task is to produce or augment a software system that is used within a work environment. A central characteristic of these systems is that they support industry specific processes. Dr. Helman considers three important problems for workplace software design: How can we build mechanisms in the design phase to help ensure that the software can be supported over time?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>How can we incorporate the needs and objectives of particular locations and not merely impose a single work process in contexts where it is not efficient? How can the time management elements of the software recognise the value of employees and their work product? Dr. Helman will show how ideas in the philosophy of language, the philosophy of knowledge, and political philosophy provide some deeply helpful approaches to these three problems.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>The talk will suggest particular design approaches, but its overall goal is to show generally how philosophical thinking can provide valuable insights for software design. The talk achieves its goal if after going over the examples software designers can apply philosophical ideas to their own software designs in a systematic way that aligns with the needs and the culture of the client industry.</strong></p>
			</span>
			<p>Dr. Helman has a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Harvard and an M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. His publications are in Philosophy, Management Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Systems Engineering and Computer Science. For the last twenty years, he has worked as a programmer and consultant, primarily in the area of Business Intelligence.</p>
