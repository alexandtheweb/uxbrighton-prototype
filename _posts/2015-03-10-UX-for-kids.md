**This event will attempt to give a broad overview of the challenges and rewards when designing for children.** 

It's easy to lump "kids" under one banner, but developmentally and in cognitive terms they're very different as toddlers than they are as a five year olds and again as eight year olds.

We're still firming up the talks, but here are some of the areas that we might to be looking at:

  * Do we need to design differently for different age-groups? What developmental changes need to be considered?

  * What common mistakes do people make when designing for children?

  * What can we learn from traditional games and gameplay?

  * What psychological techniques can help us engage children?

  * Are there specific rules we should stick to when writing copy, choosing colours and typefaces?

  * What can we learn from the design of children's books?
  
Speakers TBC.
