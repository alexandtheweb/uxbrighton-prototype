## Usable, Grammatical & Readable Code – Daniel van Berzon
<img src="/images/events/Daniel-van-Berzon.jpg" width="280" class="talk__thumb" style="border-radius: 2px;">
How can software developers learn from UX and linguistics, to help make their code more readable?

Readable code is critical, but the available advice on how to write it is full of contradictory and arbitrary rules. Grammar is also full of rules; "Prescriptive" ones that are hard to follow, and "Descriptive" ones that are intuitive.

With the help of Shakespeare, Chomsky and some little green men, we will learn the dangers of prescriptive rules, and see how the online experiment at howreadable.com applies UX research principles to uncover rules for readable code.

### About Daniel
Daniel is a software developer based in Brighton, via London and Barcelona. He has worked with the web since late last century, when EJBs were a thing. After a little Physics and a lot of Ruby on Rails, he is currently taming the front end at Ocasta Studios, and researching code readability.
