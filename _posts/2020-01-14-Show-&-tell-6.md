=======

This is a low-key event for people of all levels of UX experience. A supportive environment for talking about unfinished ideas and work-in-progress. 

Whether you’re a UXer of many years’ standing, new to UX or UX is only part of what you do, so much the better. A mix of skills and backgrounds enriches the conversation. 

**It's free. Sign up at [this shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R-1yC2k6KOF0HVlGxoEUntN8Qbo65etNDt-DRhQGP5A/edit) with your Show & Tell topic.** 

Show & Tell places are limited to 12, as we keep the group small enough for everyone in the room to learn each other's names. 


## Deciding what to share

If you’re not sure what to share at the Show & Tell, here are some prompts:

- Talk us through what you’re working on
- Show how you’re using a tool or method 
- Get advice on an approach to a project
- Share a past project
- Tell us about a new process
- Discuss working practices
- Get feedback on a talk, workshop or article idea
- Show a short demo or video

Still stuck? It’s more than fine to bring a question or introduce a topic for discussion.


## Principles

- Everyone is welcome
- Everyone brings something to talk about and some snacks to share
- Everything is off the record - [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule). (If you’re under NDA, it’s OK to be non-specific about your client. We won’t interrogate you!) 
- 15-minute timebox for each discussion 
- No polished presentations
