# Sponsors' Information

## [UX Brighton 2016](http://uxbrighton.org.uk)

## UX Brighton, 4th November. A one-day conference for UX people

<div id="body">

<p>Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks along a strong theme…</p>

<p>…This year’s theme is <strong>UX is dead! Long live UX!</strong>.</p>

<p>During this one day conference, we aim to eschew traditional thinking and examine better ways to model and think about the world. We'll see how we can learn from many disciplines and professions, not just design or UX, and demonstrate how the best design needs a foundation of empirical evidence and critical thinking.</p>

<h2>Thought Provoking speakers</h2>

<p>Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.</p>
