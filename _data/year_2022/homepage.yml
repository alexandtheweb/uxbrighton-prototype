          talk-title: Old thinking
          talk-summary: >-
            Holding the mirror up to some of the ‘new thinking’ in design and
            showing that it is the same as the ideas being explored way back in
            other design disciplines.


            This talk really recognises how young UX Design (as a discipline) is when compared to other design disciplines and asks ourselves to make the effort to learn more about the history of branding, publishing, advertising, industrial design, type design etc to see what we can learn and take forward with us.

          talk-title: Designing with artificial intelligence
          talk-summary: >-
            We are entering the age of intelligence. A time when technologists
            imbue artificially intelligent components into many products without
            a clear framework for how such intelligence is delivered to users
            consistently. It is a product designer’s job to make AI feel
            human-like and magical, not overwhelming and scary to users. When
            designing for Artificial Intelligence scenarios, whether for a large
            enterprise or small startup, setting user expectations is critical
            to deliver a reliable product. Emily will share some best practices
            from designing for AI in both large and small organizations. No
            matter the company size, a minimum viable product is important to
            design and not to be the result of unplanned feature cuts. Emily
            will share what Minimum Viable Intelligence is for an AI product,
            and how designers can deliver a clear UX when solving problems
            efficiently.


            When thinking of how to design for intelligent products, first and foremost it needs to seem competent. Users must trust the AI agent or service with information and believe that it can achieve their goal. The bar for this depends on the expectations the designer sets. The most difficult thing about breaking out of scenario-focused AI is the lack of clear boundaries. Are you aspiring to create an entire conversational AI agent? Then the bar will be high. A less intelligent Bot, however, will teach users the rails of its conversation early on to avoid disappointment. In this talk we’ll dig deeper into setting appropriate expectations when designing for AI across large and small applications.


            Emily will share how drawing on human interaction models helps designers know what to expect when people encounter their AI product. Responsiveness when users expect it is only one part of this equation. Apps that explain processes in human ways, like thinking, seeing, or reading, can benefit from showing users where they are in a process, while explaining it in natural ways. Emulating true intelligence takes more than just seeming alive and being basically competent though. To surpass users’ expectations can be a delightful moment when the product seems truly and independently intelligent.

          talk-title: The value of Design Thinking for product teams
          talk-summary: >-
            Design Thinking is a powerful mindset and framework leading to
            innovation and bringing to market impactful products/services.
            However, after the initial excitement applying it within different
            business environments, criticism started to emerge putting into
            question its value.


            This talk aims to present what makes Design Thinking a powerful tool and the type of problems is good for.


            Based on Carmen's experience working with many product teams, she will be covering the main practices diluting the Design Thinking value, and a direction to avoid ending up in disappointment.


            Like Agile and Lean, Design Thinking has its place. None of them are silver bullets. It doesn't exist a formula we can apply to solve everything in the same way. Different problems require different/flexible approaches to solve them.

          talk-title: The craft of inclusive design
          talk-summary: >-
            Inclusive design is a noble and aspirational concept; however it can
            be challenging to implement as a process and can seem inaccessible
            to client projects.


            Including the extremes, while keeping an eye on your core audience can seem like a daunting and expensive approach. What if we told you that there is a shortcut to inclusive design? Telling stories from BBC Two’s Big Life Fix, Ruby Steel will share principles that can be applied to every day projects.

            “fixer” on the BBC2 show Big Life Fix, the show that involves a team
            of inventors creating new and life-changing solutions for people in
            need. As Associate Strategy Director at Smart Design, Ruby is
            committed to making people’s lives better through the power of
            design, working across a variety of industries.

She has been awarded two Helen Hamlyn Design Awards for Creativity and Inclusive Design, and received honorable mentions from Core77 and the RSA for design solutions combating issues such as social isolation in older people.

          talk-title: Vision vs Iteration
          talk-summary: >-
            Teams iterating without a vision are working blindfolded. The
            constant demand for new features and growth often force product
            teams into endless cycles of iteration. At best, they're missing out
            on new opportunities. At worst, they’re ignoring threats that could
            upend their business.


            The struggle to plan beyond the short-term mean it's easy to ignore the future bets you need to make to survive.


            In this talk, Brendan will share models and ways of working from that designers and product owners can use to focus on both the short and long term.


            Some of the topics covered in this talk are:


            * the value of a vision,

            * how to measure big bets through experimentation, and

            * validation and turning a vision into a roadmap.

          talk-title: Scientific Design
          talk-summary: >-
            The world of UX Design is constantly in flux, and there are so many
            different approaches - some good, some not so good. UX Design is
            inherently art and science, but since the explosion in popularity of
            UX, the science component of UX Design has lost out to the more
            appealing visual design elements of the practice.


            In his talk, *Scientific Design*, Nick will show you where you can add science to your workflow to help guide your craft and to enhance your creativity, rather than to limit and stifle it. We'll cover methods for both innovation-type projects and optimisation-type projects, as well as how to apply scientific principles alongside all that you do. Adding science to design creates killer UX, and Nick will give you all the shortcuts and pointers needed to apply scientific design on the project you're currently working on.

          talk-summary: "Life is full of surprises; some are good and some are not so
            good. Our ability to stay flexible and positive under pressure can
            have a huge impact on our wellbeing. Resilience is not an innate
            capability; it's more like a muscle that can be built and
            strengthened. There are 4 pillars to well being: mental, physical,
            emotional and social. Each of these can be fortified to help us
            handle life's ups and downs, reducing the negative impact and
            allowing you to take it in your stride. In this session, we will
            talk about a few research-backed techniques that can help you bounce
            back when you need to."

            coach, Liz firmly believes that the digital community need to spend
            time turning our creative skills on ourselves occasionally, to make
            sure we operate in an environment that encourages each of us to
            succeed.
