# UX Brighton 2017 Sponsorship

UX Brighton has grown, and we're moving to the Concert Hall in the Brighton Dome; a larger, more comfortable space to accommodate the expansion. We're expecting 400+ super-savvy delegates (designers, developers, product people etc). However, just because we are growing, it doesn't mean we don't need your help - if anything, we need it more than ever!

Our delegates want to hear from companies that support us. They are looking for new jobs and new resources or tools. The UX community will share their knowledge so that those who support us will continue to receive the benefit long after. As you might expect, we’re a creative bunch so encourage our sponsors to think beyond the exhibition stand.

We've got lots of ideas, and welcome your suggestions too. Think:

**FUN** - Entertainment during the breaks in a day full of cerebral, mind expanding talks can be a great way to engage our delegates. Maybe sponsor a co-branded Photobooth.

**GREAT GIVEAWAYS** - Quality items such as branded Post-Its, Sharpies, notebooks and re-usable aluminium water bottles. Items that delegates want and use long after the conference.

**DAYTIME TREATS** - Enhance the experience by sponsoring fruit, pastries and coffee throughout the day.

**FLASH YOUR LOGO** - Lanyards, volunteer t-shirts etc

**AFTER PARTY** - Everyone loves the chance to network and discuss the day once the conference wraps, what better way than to sponsor the after party?!
