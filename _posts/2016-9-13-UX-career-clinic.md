Following the success of our last UX Career Clinic, we're back again as part of the [Brighton Digital Festival](http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/)
This event is aimed at giving careers advice to those looking to get into the industry, or move within it. This event will give job seekers unique insight from the best UX industry professionals in Brighton who will be able to give feedback on portfolios and give careers advice to help those lacking UX experience to get a foot on the careers ladder. Advisors will come from a range of different UX companies to ensure that the breadth of this exciting industry is represented.

Approximately 20 company representatives and UX freelancers will be on-hand to give one-to-one advice to those looking to get into the industry or move within it.

Confirmed mentors include: [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com), [Ribot](http://ribot.co.uk), [University of Brighton](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/), [Crunch](https://www.crunch.co.uk/), [The Unit](http://www.theunit.co.uk/), [Foolproof](http://www.foolproof.co.uk/), [Madgex](https://www.madgex.com/), [Amido](https://www.amido.com/), [Danny Hope](http://dannyhope.co.uk/), [Andy Parker](http://byandyparker.com/), [Sjors Timmer](http://notura.com/), [Patrick Sansom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricksansomdesigner), [Ben Scammels](http://www.benscammelsdesign.com/), [Cheryl Galloway](http://cherylgallaway.com/) with more to come.

The timeslots are in place to help us minimise the time you'll need to wait to talk to mentors. We won't be restricting your access in any way, we just want to help you get the most of the event. Once you've seen a mentor or two, you're free to hang out and network with other attendees.

# NB Your ticket deposit will be fully refunded so long as you attend.
