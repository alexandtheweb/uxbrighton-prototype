Mentors and mentees can meet when they wish, we ask that you commit to at least 1 hour a month until the end of the programme in April 2023, unless you've got what you need before then. You can meet virtually or face-to-face. We recommend that mentees set a goal to work towards within the programme, mentors can support mentees to achieve this goal by helping them be accountable and asking guiding questions.
