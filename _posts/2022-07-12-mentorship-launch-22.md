## What the event is for

The Mentorship Launch is the first in a series of events as part of the UX Brighton mentorship program. Use this event to get inspired and gain clarity on what you want to achieve from your mentor/ee relationship. Hear from a group of speakers with mentorship hints and tips to prepare you to get the most out of the program.

Attend the launch to meet other UXers broadening their horizons. This is where you can get ready for pairing up with your new mentor/ee at the next UX Brighton mentorship evening in August at the speed-matching event.

### Jessica Squires, Lead User Experience Architect

<img src="/images/jessica_squires_cropped.png" alt="Jessica Squires, Lead User Experience Architect." class="image-align-right"/>

Jessica is a Lead UX Architect for a large media organisation. Day to day she oversees projects, gets hands-on with wireframes (and more), collaborates with her talented UX team, and mentors’ people inside and outside of her work.

She truly enjoys mentoring, not only does she get to meet lots of wonderful people, she helps them to expand on their current knowledge, or maybe set them on a path to switch careers but she’s improved her UX practice and skillset along the way. She will talk about how you can get into mentoring, empowerment, setting boundaries and more... 

### Shrut Kirti Saksena, Senior Experience Researcher at Adobe

<img src="/images/shrut-kirti-saksena-cropped.jpg" alt="Shrut Kirti Saksena, Senior Experience Researcher at Adobe." class="image-align-right"/>

Shrut is a Cognitive Scientist and a UX Researcher with 6 years of combined experience in academic & product research. Currently, she is a Sr. Experience Researcher for Adobe’s Creative Cloud & Emerging Products team, shaping and driving the next evolution of the Creative Cloud(CC) suite of products.
In the past, she has founded & led the UX Research operations @Lollypop Design Studio(Bangalore), where she set up the UX Research function from scratch & mentored a team of UX Researchers on 30+ exploratory, evaluative UX research projects across diverse domains.

Her research expertise lies at the intersection of emerging technologies, global UX Research & operations, and cognition and behavioral sciences. She has been awarded numerous design awards such as A'design Award, Interface Red Dot Award to name a few. She is an inclusion & accessibility enthusiast, and mentors aspiring UX professionals, and emerging UX research teams @ADPList.org.

In a recent survey looking at 100 Experience Researcher job postings in the US in 2021, it was found that collaboration (84%) and business acumen(scoping, translating business requirements, & influencing product strategy) were the most sought-after requirements, other than the expected requirements of designing and conducting research studies (84%) for a UX Researcher. Also, it is no secret that there is now more demand for user insights than there are UX researchers in the industry.

Shrut's talk highlights the emerging demands of the industry from a UX Research role, elucidates why a change in perspective of mentorship & learning is required to meet these demands & how one could benefit from this perspective shift to grow into an experienced researcher: amplifying the impact of UX research and leveraging research soft-skills of collaboration, communication, connection, and influence to empower product teams & stakeholders.

### Lewis Nyman, UX, Design & Research Freelancer
