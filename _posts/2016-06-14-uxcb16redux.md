Back in March 2016, our friends [UX Camp Brighton](http://www.uxcampbrighton.org/) held their largest, most successful barcamp yet. In keeping with tradition, here at UX Brighton we're extremely happy to host the follow-up Redux event featuring sessions from the day. With over 80 speakers, selecting four has been hard work! We hope you agree we've chosen a selection of popular talks, which include fascinating subjects from many new voices.

## Effective wireframes: pitfalls to avoid and tips for success, [Al Power](http://twitter.com/alpower)
In this session I’ll look at some of the pitfalls of communicating design well through wireframes – examining some possible solutions and provide some tips for success. A short presentation followed by a collaborative discussion.

## How to get better answers from asking better questions, [Chris How](http://twitter.com/chrishow)
Want to become a question asking ninja? Asking questions is at the heart of uncovering ideas and opportunities that can then be translated into digital products and services, software and interfaces. In my session I’m going to give practical tips to answer:
* What makes a good question?
* How can I get better answers from my questions?
* How can I get better at asking questions?
And as a bonus you will get to play ‘Shit question bingo’.

## Factors of Trust in IoT App Interfaces, [Fiona McNeil](http://twitter.com/fmacneill)
Does your app rely on OAuth to offer connection to other apps and services? Based on my research studying app-to-device relationships in Internet of Things systems (e.g. Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nest, SmartThings, Glooko), I have uncovered some best practice recommendations when it comes to inspiring trust within your interface.
