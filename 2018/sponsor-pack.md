# UX Brighton 2018 Sponsorship

## [UX Brighton 2018](http://uxbrighton.org.uk)

### 2nd November, 2018. Advancing Research

About UX Brighton
-----------------

Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks around a single theme.

**This year's theme is Advancing Research**. We'll be taking a deep dive into research -- looking beyond traditional methods to tackle everything from how research can inform strategy to building research teams. From designing surveys that don't suck to researching for new technologies.

Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.

A boutique team
---------------

UX Brighton is carefully curated by [Danny Hope](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyhope/), a UX consultant with two decades of experience. Conference Producer [Emmeline Caines-Gooby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmeline-caines-gooby-9579195) ensures the conference runs like a smoothly oiled machine. They've been working together since 2011. Danny and Emm are backed up by a team of volunteers who all work to ensure the conference is a great day for all our attendees, speakers and sponsors.

If you're interested in sponsoring, please either email emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk or DM [@uxbri](https://twitter.com/direct_messages/create/uxbri) (DMs are open).

Unique venue
------------

The [Brighton Dome](https://brightondome.org/about/history_heritage/) is part of the historical and beautiful Pavilion estate, home to Prince George, the Prince Regent. Originally his riding school and stables, the Concert Hall is a stunning 1200 seated theatre. We've been holding our conference here since 2011 and love its unique brand of Brighton quirkiness.

The spacious, [double-height Foyer Bar](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.8237697,-0.1383494,0a,73.7y,159.29h,79.42t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sG_k-GAIJg7EAAAQYNxJAhQ!2e0?source=apiv3) provides an excellent space for our sponsors. It's also where our delegates congregate for refreshments, so they won't miss you!

Why sponsor us?
---------------

Brand visibility, networking, hiring quality people, brand association.

Our delegates want to engage with companies that support us. They are looking for new jobs, resources and tools. The UX community share their knowledge widely. So our supporters will reap the benefits long after the conference ends.

Custom sponsorship deal
-----------------------

As you might expect, we're a creative bunch, so encourage our sponsors to think beyond the exhibition stand.

If you don't see what you want here, contact us to discuss further - we will happily customise a package to suit your needs.

Other opportunities
-------------------

We've got lots of ideas, and welcome your suggestions too - we're more than happy to tailor a package to suit your needs.

-   FUN - Entertainment during the breaks in a day full of cerebral, mind expanding talks can be a great way to engage our delegates. Maybe sponsor a Photobooth.

-   USEFUL GIVEAWAYS - Quality items such as branded Post-Its, Sharpies, notebooks, reusable aluminium water bottles or coffee cups. Items that UX people want and use long after the conference.

-   DAYTIME TREATS - Enhance the experience by sponsoring fruit, pastries and coffee throughout the day. Or how about an on-site barista or smoothie bar?

-   FLASH YOUR LOGO - Lanyards around the neck of every delegate & speaker, volunteer t-shirts, a charging station, even the videography - we'll put your logo & URL at the beginning of each of our filmed talks.

-   POST CONFERENCE DRINKS - Everyone loves the chance to network and discuss the day once the conference wraps, what better way than to sponsor the post conference drinks?!

Drop Emm a line to let us know that you're interested in sponsoring -- <emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk>
