Most technology in education is not built for the modern learning experience. It’s complex, unpredictable and no two classes are ever the same. Teachers waste time on non-teaching activities and they find it difficult to collaborate with other teachers. At Firefly, we’re freeing teachers to have a greater impact on the learning experience. Firefly allows teachers to innovate and cater to each student’s needs, preparing all students for success in the future.

**How you can help**

We already have a rich legacy, we’ve won loads of awards and have earned a reputation as the easiest to use school learning tool. But we have even greater ambitions to help every student reach their full potential. We’re at a pivotal point in what we do, with big plans for our product and exciting opportunities ahead of us. We want to work with an expert in user research so that we all understand the challenges in modern education better. With your guidance, we’ll be able to make the best decisions for our product based on what matters most to schools.

- Is empathetic towards the needs of all the different stakeholders on a project. This means being flexible and striking a balance between meticulous insights gathering, and enabling the team to take action.

*In return, you will benefit from:*

- Being able to establish the practice of User Researcher within the organisation

- Being part of a growing and thriving Product/Design organisation

- Being able to have a real impact on the usability of our products and thus aid teaching and learning.

*You have proven experience in the following:*

- This is a senior role so we are looking for someone with at least 4 years experience of hands on user research for products that have shipped.

- You have experience with a range of quantitative and qualitative methodologies such as ethnographic studies, usability testing, remote testing and survey design.

- You have lead product teams through a variety of different generative and evaluative projects.

- You have previously worked in an agile environment with a product, service or UX Design team.

- This role would be perfect for someone looking for their first senior role, especially if you’ve been working as part of a larger research team and ready to take a step up to lead the process yourself.

*Your first couple of months:*

- Lots of introductions with people and teams across the business where you can learn about our purpose, our product strategy, our process and our plans for the future.

- Learning about all the different ways we currently gather knowledge about our users.

- Visiting schools, getting to know what the modern learning experience is like.

- Absorbing the research that has been done so far to familiarise yourself with our users and areas of focus.

- Coaching the team in all the different research methods that they can call on to conduct research and solve problems themselves.

*Over time:*

- Carry out a variety of quantitative and qualitative studies with people from schools, both remote and in-person.

- Engage with third party research agencies to source participants.

- Helping us find a consistent way of storing our knowledge, making sure it is accessible to everyone, and where everyone can contribute.

- Working with the Design Lead and PMs to develop a research roadmap.

- Developing a toolkit of research methods, report templates and a shared vocabulary for our research practices.

**Our team**

You’ll be joining the Design team as the first UX Researcher. We’re a small team, but are respected across the whole company for our expertise and commitment to providing the best experience for our users. We work closely with the Product team, so we continually have the opportunity to guide and shape the direction of the product. We’re really passionate about design, and love to do meaningful work and get things done.

We aim to learn at every opportunity. We receive an annual training budget and use this to attend conferences, workshops, take online courses and have shelves full of books in our workspaces. We like to hang out together too–we go for dinner together regularly and do all sorts of activities with the wider Firefly team.

You can read a bit more about some of our recent design activities in our team blog https://medium.com/firefly-design and see a video of what it’s like to work at Firefly.

*Location, travel and flexibility:*

- We ideally want someone who is either based primarily in London (our office is in Hammersmith) or is happy to spend some of the time there.

- We are open minded about the possibility of someone who wishes to work remotely in the UK some or even most of the time. Tell us on your application and we can talk about it with you if you are short-listed.

- Some travel will be required to meet customers and attend research sessions but much of the work we do can be done remotely in the UK.

- We understand the need for flexibility due to the nature of this job so we are happy to discuss flexible working arrangements.

You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You think strategically**

You are a big–picture thinker but understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues and workshops are often your medium of choice. Your primary outputs are invariably physical rather than digital - such as walls full of post-it notes.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your findings and ideas with colleagues, peers and the community, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as JTBD or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

### Does this sound like you?

If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

We’re a group of smart, passionate people with the support, trust and freedom to do the job we love. We’re free from the typical constraints of big agencies and have fostered a culture that encourages you to do the best and most fulfilling work of your career. There are a number of key attitudes shared by everyone at Clearleft:

**You get under the skin of problems**

You insist on a deeper understanding of the problem before rushing into solutions, even if that sometimes means starting out with ‘just enough research’. You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You’re a visual thinker**

You understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. Workshops are often your medium of choice. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues, but you’re also hands-on enough to help bring those ideas into reality.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your ideas with colleagues and peers, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as Lean or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

# Does this sound like you?
If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

**Some things worth noting**

- Applicants should be eligible to work in the UK
- We are keeping this vacancy open until it is filled, which means there is no closing date for applications
- We endeavour to get in touch with candidates within four weeks of you contacting us, which typically begins with a casual chat prior to a more formal interview process

We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly. We’re expanding our team to make our brand (even more) famous, bringing the benefits of smarter and fairer car insurance to more motorists.

We’re looking for a talented UX/UI designer with a strong portfolio that’s interested in helping continue to build and improve a market-leading car insurance app and web platform, as well as helping shape the future of a young brand.

As car insurance is a legal requirement in the UK, it’s a product that appeals to many different types of people. Our members are from all over the country, aged from 23 through to 78, and we know we can only keep doing our best work with a diverse team that reflects that.

Working for a startup, you’ll be involved in all areas of a product lifecycle, from the initial discovery phase to supporting developers as they get your work into production. You’ll be helping with everything from building on the foundations of the brand and evolving our character, iterating on the existing UX/UI of our app, web platform, website and quote journey as well as our internal admin panel. You’ll also be creating, leading and documenting improvements to our style, UI library and design process.

In your portfolio it would be great to see examples of work all the way through the process - from wireframing through to final design. Please also share any examples of your experience in the discovery, planning and testing process.



**You will be:**

- Working closely with our Head of Brand & Product and Product Manager, leading the design of all of our external and internal products.
- The voice of digital product design within the business, interpreting objectives and goals from across the business and transforming them into fully designed end-to-end flows and concepts.
- Responsible for building on, moulding and evolving our UI guidelines and processes, continuing to build out our libraries, templates and toolkits to ensure our style is always consistent.
- Collaborating with product managers and developers within an agile/scrum sprint framework to iterate on new features and UX/UI improvements to our app, web platform, emails, website and quote site.
- Helping create and establish an efficient and scalable design system.
- Working closely with our marketing and content team to deliver features, in-app or onsite campaigns and digital design concepts to support nationwide marketing and press campaigns.
- Collaborating with freelance designers or outside agencies, where appropriate, to produce work to the same high standard as you do.
- Visualising data, infographics and illustrations for reports, pitch decks, emails and blogs.


This role will primarily be based in our London office (so wouldn't be suitable for someone looking to work remotely full time), but we're always open to remote or more flexible working arrangements if travel, childcare or something else gets in the way. This is subject to our flexible working policy, and we can discuss this in more detail if you come for interview.



**We’d like to meet someone with:**

- Experience in UX/UI design, who can share work they’ve done across apps, responsive webpages and purchase flows.
- A good attention to detail and an eye for consistency across multiple touchpoints.
- A high standard of icon and vector illustration (demonstrated by a strong portfolio) and basic experience of animation/motion graphic experience.
- The desire to work together with different teams across our business to solve problems and bounce around ideas that can improve life for our members and make our service better.
- Experience using the full Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Adobe After Effects primarily) and Sketch (for digital designs), alongside use of hand-over and prototyping tools. Experience with any other platforms will be a bonus.
- The confidence to prep, plan and run discovery workshops, planning sessions and usability workshops.


**Bonus points if you:**

- Have experience working at or with an early stage startup.
- Have a basic flair for copywriting.
- Have had any exposure (however limited) to coding, HTML or front-end development - whether that’s in website design, email building or creating banner ads.


**What are the benefits?**

- Enrolment into the By Miles pension plan after passing your three month probation.
- Local gym membership discount.
- Remote and flexible working opportunities (subject to our remote and flexible working policy).
- Personal training budget (to support professional development and certification).
- Personal book budget (so you can add to our ever-growing library).
- Access to monthly sessions with our independent coach to help with personal & professional development and wellness at work.
- Regular social events.
- Join a fast-growing and exciting startup with excellent growth opportunities.
- Work with a fun and highly-motivated team where there's never a dull moment.
- West London office (Hammersmith) with great transport links (District, Circle, Hammersmith & City and Piccadilly Lines).

At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

## About You

As a UI/UX Designer, you will help to deliver world class customer experiences for our clients, guiding them on best practice in visual design, user experience and design development, as well as delivering design outputs of your own.

* This is a client facing delivery role with a mix of advising, implementing and delivering, sometimes across multiple clients

* You’ll engage closely with the client and Scrum teams to review current design processes and methods, before making your recommendation and making it happen!

## Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:

* We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
* There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
* Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

## What we’ll offer you
Professional development. Accelerated career progression. An environment that encourages entrepreneurial spirit. It’s all on offer at Capgemini.

## Why we’re different
At Capgemini, we help organisations across the world become more agile, more competitive and more successful. Smart, tailored, often-groundbreaking technical solutions to complex problems are the norm. But so, too, is a culture that’s as collaborative as it is forward thinking. Working closely with each other, and with our clients, we get under the skin of businesses and to the heart of their goals. You will too.
Capgemini is proud to represent nearly 130 nationalities and its cultural diversity. Our holistic definition of diversity extends beyond gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, race, age and religion. Capgemini views diversity as everything that makes us who we are as an organization, including our social background, our experiences in life and work, our communication styles and even our personality.  These dimensions contribute to the type of diversity we value the most: diversity of thought.
We want to make sure that we find the right people to work in our teams, and we know that working full-time isn’t necessarily right for everyone. So we’d love to hear from you if you feel you’re a great fit for this role, and would like to work flexibly. As an example, some of our team members work four days a week, but travel across the UK during their working days. Or you might prefer to work three days a week (in a job share scenario) with travel limited to Greater London. If you are the right person for this role, we’ll find the right working approach for you.

Gousto is on a mission to change the way that people cook. We believe home cooking is important, so we’ve made it simple. We take the hassle out of planning, shopping and cooking, by delivering weekly meals with precisely measured ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes, so there’s no more ‘what’s for dinner’ panic.

As one of the most dynamic and fast-growing start-ups in the UK, Gousto currently leads the category offering more choice, more delivery options and lower lead times than any of its competitors.

This is really only the beginning though, we have big plans to transform our proposition in 2020 and beyond.

## The Team

The company is in a period of rapid growth, this is particularly true in the Product & Technology team. We are ~ 80 people currently and will be ~100 people at the end of this year with plans (and funding) to be over 220 by 2022. As part of this, Digital Product is a team with a strong culture of learning, curiosity, continuous improvement and collaborative ways of working in order to drive the commercial success of the business through better understanding and serving our customers.

The entire team at Gousto is enormously driven - We want to win this market. The environment, underpinned by our ownership principles, is highly dynamic, so everyone has measurable impact and can make a real difference.

## The Role

Our Digital Product team is split into two areas; Demand, which is all things eCommerce, plus Supply which is all things relating to our supply chain, capacity` and delivery.

Within Demand we currently have 5 product managers, which will soon be increasing. Demand is split into two Tribes. Growth (acquisition and retention) plus Menu (helping customers discover recipes they love, including the internal capabilities to do this)

This role as the Head of Product (ecommerce) is to guide and shape the evolution of Demand as we scale through 2022 and beyond, where we expect to double the engineers working across Demand.

This is a new role, reporting directly to the VP of Digital Product and taking on management of the growing team of PMs.

This role will be critical to the business, not just by shaping significant growth but by delivering on increased expectations and ambition across our digital experience and beyond.

The role will be accountable for the performance of the Product Management as a function, plus the success of the squads in which they are embedded. Through this you will;

1.  Ensure Product Teams deliver on ambitious and stretching OKRs
1.  Shape our teams and capabilities to support the growth ambitions of Gousto
1. Create an environment that promotes autonomy and accountability through those teams
 
 The role will also be responsible for taking hands on responsibility in the Menu tribe as the Product Lead. This gives the opportunity to shape the discovery and delivery of the most visible part of the Gousto digital experience.

You will be expected to contribute more broadly across the whole of Product and Technology in both the day to day and in the overall strategy. This will require working closely and collaboratively with peers, the Gousto Tech Management Team and across the whole business.

A successful candidate for the role will need to have a strong intellectual curiosity, be able to drive change into a growing and maturing teams, and be passionate about all things Product Development. Constantly driving and searching for continuous improvement/best practice in a lean, asynchronous and distributed environment.

Our ideal candidate will have a proven track record in building and scaling successful Product teams. We want someone with excellent leadership skills and a solid understanding of what it takes to design and deliver products customers love, which in turn drive commercial success.

A key requirement for the role will be a strong ability to build relationships and communicate at all levels - this role will equally need to influence an Engineering team plus Gousto’s Management and Leadership teams.

Most importantly we’re keen to shape the role around the successful candidate, their strengths and the experience they need to help shape their career.

# Department Overview
 
The world of payments is changing rapidly. New innovative technologies are being developed to meet the changing needs but these can give rise to new threats to users of the payments system, and to the stability of that system as a whole. This means that we need ever stronger protections and more resilient infrastructure.


The Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) lies at the heart of UK payments.  In total, RTGS settles around £650bn of payments each working day, close to a third of the UK’s annual GDP. The RTGS infrastructure is over 20 years old and, despite its excellent operational record, it needs to be modernised and developed to meet today’s needs. Balancing the safeguarding of stability whilst enabling innovation.



The [RTGS Renewal Programme](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-renewal-programme) has been established to develop the next generation of the Bank of England’s Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system.  The way payments are made has changed dramatically in recent years, reflecting changes in the needs of households and companies, changes in technology, and an evolving regulatory landscape.  The range of payment providers is growing rapidly.  Given the implications of these changes for the Bank’s mission and for users, businesses and regulators, it is important that the Bank consider how RTGS will need to evolve to meet and shape payments trends in the coming decades.



The Programme is now in the Design-Enable-Procure (DEP) stage.  After having defined the Programme scope, with input from the payments industry, we are running a procurement process under the Official Journal of the European Union to appoint a Technology Delivery Partner.  They will work with the Bank on the design and build of the core settlement engine.  We plan to enter the contract with the Technology Delivery Partner in Summer 2020. During this DEP stage, we have been working closely with internal and external stakeholders impacted by the change and have looked to deliver early benefits and increased resilience where possible.  

 



# Job Description



Reporting to the Lead Software Assurance Architect, you will be responsible for defining User Experience patterns, Standards and Policies in support of the whole RTGS solution. You will work closely with relevant business stakeholders, product owners and developers to transform the current user journeys into a crisp and simplified experience. You will also be working closely with our Technical Delivery Partner and the wider Bank to align design standards across all of the different components of the RTGS system.



The Bank is investing in building an experienced design and engineering team who will be responsible for building and operating the renewed RTGS service. The User Experience and User Interface design and implementation will be a key component of this service.

Gravity Sketch is a London-based startup that is shaking up the 3D design space and transforming the future of digital creation. Just like Adobe revolutionised 2D design, our vision is to revolutionise 3D design today. Backed by high profile VCs and investors from Silicon Valley, London and Tokyo, we are developing the first enterprise-grade immersive 3D design and collaboration software which allows designers, engineers, and other stakeholders to create remotely together, in real-time, across multiple devices and platforms. We aim to transform the future of digital creation through disrupting the current design and engineering workflows, placing the user at the center of the creation process. Our product is used by thousands of designers in industries such as automotive, apparel and film, across North America, Europe, and Asia.

## Responsibilities

You will work with the product team, users and the Customer Success team to understand the software inside out & build a deep understanding of the vision of Gravity Sketch, who we imagine users to be, who they really are, and how we can help them. 

You will gather research on our users & customer base in a variety of ways (including a deep dive through the existing customer feedback & Discord channel)  in order to understand issues they are having with the software, what the root cause of their issues are, and how we can solve problems in a “Gravity Sketch” way. This will involve logging the feedback from the research above in an organized way and logging requests from existing customer feedback and Discord feedback channel. 

You’ll have an opportunity to take an active part in discussions about users, new features, and development challenges we might face in solving problems, and conduct interviews with our clients & power users, then collate and use that feedback. 
Test and coordinate with users that are testing new features and prototypes, and be an active part in discussions around what works/doesn’t work, good/bad, pro/con

## Role Progression

As you continue to grow in the role, you will work with the product team to come up with briefs to solve problems, and help us build, define, and come up with best practices of the Gravity Sketch design philosophy and a design culture across the company

Over time, you’ll work closely with the engineering team and design team to break down which problems and solutions we should tackle, how to solve user problems in an effective way. You will figure out the low hanging fruit, but also how we can schedule in larger scale improvements to the application. 

For personal & professional development, you will actively learn Unity in order to enhance your prototyping abilities, with the goal to work closely with our design  and engineering teams to create prototypes within our proof of concept developments on various features and areas of the software.

Simply Business is well prepared to deal with unprecedented events. We’re an agile business by nature – and our hiring and interview process is no exception. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some parts of our hiring process may take a little longer than usual.  Please bear with us, and rest assured that we're happy to hear from you and receive your application.

If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone. If you don’t have access to either of these, or you need support with your application, get in touch with us at careers@simplybusiness.co.uk. Similarly, please email us if you’re not well, you’re self-isolating, or if you want to pause your application for a bit – we’ll be happy to keep you updated on future opportunities like the one below.

Technology. Award-winning customer service. Bleeding-edge data ability. Simply Business is a new type of insurance company, using all of the above to create the best possible insurance experience for small businesses and self-employed people. We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea.

It’s a great place to work.

There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute.

Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working  life that helps us thrive, not stick. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey  to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.

We’re looking for an experienced digital Product Designer to help us redefine how insurance works for the entrepreneurs and small business owners who are the lifeblood of the UK and US economies. You’ll lead design within a cross functional product team focused on attracting new audiences to our global platform which already provides tailored, transparent insurance to over half a million businesses and landlords. Sitting in our talented Customer Experience Team you will have the support of teammates skilled in user research, customer insight, behavioural science and product design.

## You should apply if:
* you can demonstrate how you obsess equally over the definition of the problem as you do the precision of the pixels
* you’ve a relentless curiosity with people; the decisions they make and why they make them
* your work shows empathy for customer needs, consideration of technical constraints and a focus on the business value of your solutions
* you’ve experience working on experiments with user researchers, and are able to identify the most appropriate use of qualitative and quantitative studies to inform design decisions
* you embrace collaboration and perform your best when you involve your product team in the design process
* you encourage feedback on your work and carefully consider how you ensure the feedback you offer to team members is useful
* you care about inclusive design and will ensure that accessibility standards are maintained as we evolve our design system
* you can show us a portfolio with detailed examples of beautiful interface design showing a command of design details such as layout, typography, colour, iconography, spacing and motion
* you are expert at using all the usual design software including Sketch, Figma, Zeplin, Invision and Principle

## What are the benefits?

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call ‘core benefits’. On top of that, you can pick and choose from the more exciting options we offer – whether it’s a full gym membership or gym subsidy, comprehensive private health cover, extra holiday, or a National Trust pass. 

**The ‘core’ stuff**
Some of these will kick in once you’re confirmed in post, but here’s the summary:
* a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day, generous annual leave
* life assurance (financial cover for your family, should the worst happen)
* a cash plan to reimburse your everyday medical expenses
* an extra day off if you get married or move house
* an automatic enrollment pension (employer-matched at 5%) 

**The fun stuff**
We also have a great deal more to pick and mix from, with things like:
* a full gym membership
* private medical insurance
* extra days annual leave
* shopping vouchers
* dental insurance
* travel insurance

But there’s so much more to Simply Business than insurance and memberships. We also commit to flexible working options, smart working (our offices are kitted out for you to work when and how you choose), cycle to work, eye test vouchers, and season ticket loan schemes, and we have a handy online form to put in any training or conference requests.

Best of all, though, are the groups, clubs, and adventures that come with the Simply Business territory. Forget a simple Give As You Earn scheme (although we’ve got that too) – we trek the Sahara for charity, take you on weekends away, throw epic summer parties, and meet up for book groups, public speaking coaching, yoga, manicures, beer brewing, and lots, lots more.

## Our values

Everything we do comes down to these five values – empowerment, authenticity, simplicity, learning and pioneering. In practice, these will mean something unique to every  person at Simply Business, but if you’re considering working here, give them some thought. They’re at the heart of our story.

### Empowerment
We believe in our people and the positive impact they can have so we enable everyone to stretch themselves

### Authenticity
We celebrate diversity, avoid jargon and genuinely care about helping small businesses thrive

### Simplicity
We attempt to simplify complex solutions to save our customers time and effort

### Learning
We’re never done learning about new possibilities and act to explore them

### Pioneering
We’re obsessed with finding new ways to create even better  experiences

Panaseer is changing the face of enterprise security. Our platform helps businesses make informed, risk-based security decisions and substantiate regulatory compliance. We've won numerous awards, including the [Editor’s Choice award from Cyber Defence Magazine](https://panaseer.com/press-releases/panaseer-wins-at-infosec-awards-during-rsa-conference-2020/) at the RSA Conference 2020.

The Panaseer platform takes data from security, IT and business solutions to build trusted asset inventories, identify gaps in security controls and arm both security teams and executives with metrics that enable them to make decisions. By automating security control monitoring and reporting it helps Security, Risk and IT teams collaborate more effectively and answer the most challenging questions they face. Questions like: ‘How secure are our organisation's most critical assets?’, and ‘Where do I prioritise my limited resources for best effect?’ Design is often ignored in security products, but recent feedback from our customers confirmed that design and user experience are key differentiators for Panaseer.

Sound good? We're on the lookout for enthusiastic designers with fresh perspectives to help us deliver the Panaseer vision.

Most days you’ll be in East London (we have a cool Tech office with a running track, table tennis, drinks fridge etc… sort of thing you’d expect from the world’s number one sports betting and gaming business). **Check it out [here]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2ZkHwBvEQU&feature=youtu.be).

*Despite the current circumstances we are still actively recruiting for roles. In compliance with UK Government advice relating to COVID-19 this role will be remotely based in line with our current workforce and we will supply you with the tools and technologies to enable you to do so. Similarly all interviews will be conducted by google hangouts or equivalent video conferencing technologies.*

It's a particularly exciting time for Product at Which? as we drive forward our ambitious transformation programme, putting users at the heart of every product we create evolving our technologies to deliver best in class user experiences. Over the next twelve months we will be developing both our commercial and advocacy product offering, trialing new ways of working and driving innovative approaches  at every opportunity.

## What will I be doing?

This is a varied role and no two days will be the same. You'll be part of the UXDR team and involved with two squads in a fast paced agile environment. As the squad's dedicated User Experience Researcher, you'll be involved at each stage of the design process, from discovery research that will shape the squad's strategy, to proposition validation, and evaluation of the product. What's more the research that you do will be fundamental to our user-centred approach, and you'll see your insights come to life as they are implemented across our products.

You'll have the opportunity to speak with a wide range of people both inside and outside of the business, from in-house Designers and Product Managers to prospective students and expectant mothers. You'll take ownership of your projects, working closely with the UX team and Product Managers to generate new opportunities for research.

While we maintain social distancing, those activities could include diary studies, remote unmoderated tests, and remote interviews. When we are allowed to see other people again, the techniques could then involve face-to-face interviews, contextual enquiries, and any other methodology that you feel could address the squad's needs. The rest is really up to you. You will have the scope to get involved in side projects, such as setting up an onsite testing environment, trying out emerging research techniques and mentoring other team members. 

To enable you to do all the above, we will equip you with the tools you need to run research remotely (i.e. Video Conferencing, UserTesting.com, OptimalWorkshop) and, as long as it is deemed safe form COVID-19, the resources to run research in-person (e.g. a purpose built lab, recording equipment for in-field research).  

## What's the team like?

You'll be joining an established UX and Design team of 14 consisting of User Researchers, UX Designers and Digital Designers. There is a real cross section of skill-sets within the team from deep technical experts to those that take a more strategic approach. The team are respected for their expertise, guide and shape our product offering and have real influence at a strategic level. Innovative and open to new approaches they have successfully established and embedded new ways of working that ensure the customer is at the heart of decision making. We encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing and we hope that you will enjoy working as part of an energetic and passionate team that like to get things done!

## What we're looking for:

As a driven user advocate you will:

* need to have solid experience of running user interviews and usability testing. (Any experience of remote user testing would be a great benefit, but not essential for your application).
* have some experience of quantitative methods as well, and have the ability to synthesize qualitative and quantitative insights to provide compelling recommendations.
* be motivated to run projects autonomously and be proactive in involving different teams in gathering, sharing and presenting insights. 
* have the drive to seek out new research opportunities and be adaptable to support different research needs, keeping ahead of best practices, new methodologies and tools. 

## What we'll give you in return

When we're back in the office you'll find it modern, relaxed and friendly (including fresh fruit, subsidised canteen, great facilities for cyclists and lunchtime runners, two free healthy meals per week and a roof terrace to enjoy them on). We have a 35 hour working week and offer flexible working with each team working one day from home (prior to lockdown).

There are excellent benefits including 28 days annual leave, private healthcare, and excellent pension scheme (and the usuals... Cycle to Work, season ticket loan scheme etc.) We even have access to a private section of Regent's park which is handy for hot summers and team building events!

**At Which? we value diversity and we're committed to creating an inclusive culture where everyone is able to be themselves and to reach their full potential. We want to receive applications from people of all backgrounds and cultures and believe that a diverse workforce helps us to understand and create a positive impact for consumers. We want to ensure that everybody can apply and be part of our recruitment processes, and therefore when required we make reasonable adjustments to accommodate our candidates.**

Our UX Design team is integral to this – working with researchers, product owners, software engineers and others to get the heart of customer needs, and designing and testing solutions that are ready for changing customer expectations. 
Initially, you’ll be focused on our growing portfolio of money products – think credit cards, loans, current accounts, savings, mortgages, and more.

It’s an area we know we have a massive opportunity to grow in, so you’ll be joining one of our newest “mobs” – the collective name for a group of meerkats – in a team of research, design, and optimisation, working alongside our product teams to make money simple for our customers.

You’ll be the senior designer in your mob, so we will need you to guide and coach others in design thinking and practices, within both the design and product community!

You’ll also be part of our wider design team, which currently consists of 12 designers, but is set to grow to 24 by this time next year! There are plenty of opportunities for coming together, sharing, and growing here (even remotely!)

And remember, we’re not just about form filling – our design team is working across our mobile app, content, design system, and new features that will help reduce the burden of admin on customers.

We’ve also got the benefit of an in-house research lab, where (under normal circumstances!) designers and researchers work together to really hear what our customers think of us! And during lockdown, we have an array of remote research tools at our disposal.
Our design team has been growing for the last three years, and we’re ready to expand further. We want designers who are passionate about solving problems for customers, collaboration, and ultimately designing delightful, usable, and empowering new products across different platforms.

If that sounds like you, then let’s talk.

## What will it take to be successful?

* Senior UX Designer with a portfolio (in any format) to illustrate
* Confident to lead and guide less experienced designers
* Proficient with Sketch/Figma (for wireframing and design), Axure (for prototyping), and InVision (or equivalents) 
* Experience in working with design systems is highly desirable. We are currently building our new design system, and this role will play a key role in utilising design components, as well as feeding in new ideas to our design systems team.
* Evidence of playing a leading role UX process delivery applied to different projects – research, ideation, sketching, prototyping and delivery for example
*  Experience with customer research methods to understand customer needs and validate/challenge design and experience decisions
* Experience collaborating with product owners, researchers and software engineers to deliver successful experience designs
*  Native mobile UX experience is highly desirable but not essential

We aim to make travel easier and more accessible, encouraging people to make more environmentally sustainable travel choices. We’re hugely proud to be the world’s leading independent rail and coach travel platform and rank among the highest-rated travel and ticketing apps globally. Today, we offer our customers travel to thousands of destinations in and across 45 countries in Europe and beyond. That’s more than £3.7 billion in ticket sales annually, and over 96 million visits to our apps and websites each month. In another major milestone, last summer Trainline listed on the London Stock Exchange and is now part of the FTSE 250.
 
Our culture is central to our success. We’re driven to sustain our phenomenal growth from recent years, and this means we’re always working closely and collaboratively to turn our ideas into reality. It’s this sense of pace, innovating and improving pretty much everything we do, that makes Trainline so exciting and unique - we truly believe our work has a genuine impact and will change travel for the better.
 
To support our ambitious commercial goals, we’re expanding our world-class Product division to drive the next stage of our development. In this newly created role, you’ll be working in a hybrid channel and mission org alongside Product Owners, User Researchers, Data Scientists and Engineers to help us revolutionise the travel experience and develop a market leading product and features. The goals are ambitious and the mandate is clear – to make travel more personal.
 
As a Product Designer, you will champion the need to deeply understand customer needs and craft beautiful, easy to use solutions to meet them. With a strong understanding of interaction design and a love for how visual design complements that, you will support the design experience through the full product process. You’ll be in your element throwing ideas in to help us discover the next big thing, undertaking detailed UX iterations based on customer testing, or designing jaw-dropping visual interactions.  
  
You’ll be joining our App team focused on pioneering a great native experience for customers across the UK and international markets and helping them to book, travel and keep coming back. Due to differences across markets and languages, you’ll tackle complex user-problems to ensure that every experience feels local.

## Experience 
  
We’re looking for creative big thinkers with small egos who want to build relevant and long-lasting solutions on behalf of millions of customers. As a passionate design professional, you’ll be someone who leans more to the visual design end of the spectrum, but can still hold their own at all stages of the design process. Similarly, experience in native app design and the nuances between Apple and Google platforms are critical. You’ll be used to participating in design workshops and will bring a user centred design approach to everything you do. You’ll know what ‘great’ looks like and drive towards that relentlessly. 
  
You enjoy complex design challenges, validating ideas with data and customer research, and understand that success is positively impacting customer behaviour, not just about shipping a release. You’ll bring experience designing digital products and systems, not just apps. Additionally, you will be a true self-starter who can deeply collaborate with Engineers and Product Owners.

* **Constant stream of new challenges.** The pace at which Graphy is growing brings new technical and business challenges each day. There's a very large and exciting opportunity ahead for us which requires us all to wear multiple hats, and keeps every day exciting.


## The opportunity 😎

*London / Remote (BST to BST+2)*

At Graphy, design matters deeply to us. We believe that data has gotten a bad rap. Highly technical, overly complicated tools have made working with data onerous, tedious, and difficult. Our goal is to make working with data light, joyful, and collaborative. And we know it's going to take a lot of very good design to get there.

That's where you come in: As the first full-time product designer at Graphy you'll have the opportunity to help us build the next generation data platform from the ground up. You'll also be instrumental in shaping our design culture, systems, and team. 🚀


## What you'll do 👩‍🏫
* Partner closely with Product and Customer Success to do in-depth qualitative and quantitative user research to deeply understand the problem space.
* Work through design problems from start to finish. Once you have a deep understanding of the problem space you'll clearly articulate why these problems matters to our customers and what we plan to do to solve them.
* This includes experimenting with various solutions, creating flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visual mockups and prototypes for new products and features.
* Partner closely with Product to build our product roadmap.
* You'll also own our nascent design system:
 * This includes researching best practices and taking inspiration from others.
 * Work directly with the CEO to help create a beautiful, unique, and coherent design language and style for Graphy.
 * Design and collaborate with engineers to implement new React UI components and improve existing ones.

## Requirements
**What we look for** 👀
* Great taste and ability to translate that taste into beautiful UI & visual design of modern products, balancing a maniacal focus on details with a pragmatic focus on the business goals.
* An ability to distill complex and often ambiguous problems into effective solutions that carefully navigate the right tradeoffs.
* Strong communication skills.
* Enthusiasm for scaling Graphy's team.
* Familiarity with tools such as Figma / Sketch / Framer / Invision.
* Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
* Basic understanding of front-end JavaScript; you won't be expected to code, but an understanding of the constraints is key.
* To be in a timezone between BST and BST+2.

It's a plus if you have some experience with:

* Building React-based components.
* Designing animations & transitions.
* Building for accessibility.
* Rendering React components to Figma / Sketch / Framer.

## Your team: 
Content Platforms. Content Platforms provides the multiple Editorial teams in NUK with the tools & services that they need to inform and entertain the world. Our mission is to simplify and transform the digital tools and content systems in our newsrooms to enable content creators to focus on what they do best: producing quality content with creativity and innovation. We are a diverse team currently spread between London, Sofia and Bangalore. 
Why are we hiring? News UK has multiple newsrooms and teams producing and managing large volumes of quality content. The tools and services that are currently used have largely grown up organically over time and this has led to inefficient workflows and multiple tools largely doing the same tasks. 
By bringing all of our newsroom digital tools and content systems together under one team we can begin to simplify the numbers of tools that we have and focus on providing the right tools and workflows to pursue our digital ambitions.
This strategy of simplification and transformation to create tools that allow our content creators to focus on creativity and creation rather than content management is aligned to the overall News Corp strategy. 

## Your role:
To gain an intimate understanding of our newsrooms, how they work and their user needs. To identify pain points and where time is lost struggling with tools and/or processes instead of producing quality content. To spot where users must find alternative ways to get their job done because the content platforms systems fall short of meeting their needs. To spot where we could solve a common problem and where there are opportunities to share / re-use across multiple Newsrooms. 

To work with Product & Engineering to research if others have solved the problem and how we could do the same or improve upon it. To maintain a focus on delivering value quickly and iteratively by finding solutions that answer ‘what’s the simplest thing we could do to make it better / faster / easier?’ To strive towards a consistent user experience across newsrooms & tools where it brings value. 
Ultimately, to work as a teammate in Content Platforms and a Partner to our Editorial teams to create a Digital Content Platform that’s so good, Editorial and Technology teams prefer to use it.

## What we’re looking for from you: 
* Experience working in an agile environment 
* Experience practising product design in an iterative manner (not all up front) 
* Confident visual thinker, with portfolio showing UI design work including typography and styling. 
* Experience working with analytics to define and measure success. 
* Experience inheriting and interpreting research to aide design.

## Nice to have: 
* Experience working with content management or publishing workflows and services

Condé Nast is a global media company, home to iconic brands including Vogue, The New Yorker, GQ, Glamour, AD, Vanity Fair and Wired, among many others. The company's award-winning content reaches 84 million consumers in print, 367 million in digital and 379 million across social platforms, and generates more than 1 billion video views each month. 

The company is headquartered in London and New York, and operates in 32 markets worldwide, including China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico & Latin America, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, the U.K. and the U.S., with local license partners across the globe. 

Our goal is to create a unified user experience for each of our brands and products which exemplify ux best-practices and put the user at the heart of the experience. We are building a multi-disciplined product design team to evolve these products. You will be part of that effort working within our B2B product space, specifically with Vogue Business,  to sculpt memorable experiences that improve the engagement and loyalty of our users.
 
This role fits a highly collaborative, hands-on ux researcher with B2B product experience. You will have a passion for user centred design and data with an intense attention to detail. You must be an expert at using and analysing data together with your traditional ux-research skills to inform the iterative design process. You will be part of a small, but growing product design team and you’ll be involved at an exciting time of change and rapid iteration. This is a real opportunity to influence the look, feel and functionality of these heavy-weight brands and how they work for the user across multiple platforms.
 
You will have the chance to help define what we ship and how we ship it, ensuring design and the user have a voice at all points in the process. You'll get a rare look at digital publishing around the world. You'll be working with experienced people in product, editorial, engineering, data and design who’ve all succeeded in similar challenges.

## Key Duties & Responsibilities
* Responsible for championing user research to brief the product teams on how our users are interacting with our products. Proactively seeking opportunities to share your experiences and approaches within the team but also in the wider company. You have the ability to communicate research effectively, regardless of the audience.
* You are a researcher with multiple years of experience in qualitative and quantitative research. You will be responsible for conducting relevant research necessary for the different stages of product development, and you are always willing to try out new approaches to share and apply the findings of your research. 
* You will conduct exploratory and strategic research, but you have experience in doing research in all the different stages of product development.  Due to the nature of our products it would be advantageous to have experience of working with an international customer base.
* You will plan and facilitate scoping sessions for complex projects (multi-method, multi-stage) and align research activities to support stakeholder decision-making and action.
* You will support product teams at each level of the product development cycle from the more strategic to the more tactical. You are willing to shape the strategy of the product team by planning and conducting exploratory research when the users problems to solve aren’t defined yet.

313,Product Designer,FIBR,FALSE,"Sun, 18 Oct ’20",,,https://lendflo.applytojob.com/apply/RZXugIgK6I/Product-Designer,duvt56,/jobs/logos/FIBR-logo.png,London,,Permanent,,,,,,,FALSE,https://lendflo.applytojob.com/apply/RZXugIgK6I/Product-Designer,,2 Nov,"Thanks for checking out the Product Design role at FIBR. We’re super excited to welcome a wonderful new team member to help us change the way SMEs access finance and grow our team. 

## About FIBR

Small businesses have always struggled to access finance. Traditional lenders typically make this process cumbersome, expensive, and full of hurdles, especially for small businesses. We are able to take this hassle out of the experience. 

 FIBR is a small Fintech company focussed on making SME lending fairer and a better experience and have recently obtained substantial funding for our expansion in Europe. Our vision is to become a pan-EU SME platform, starting in the UK and Netherlands, and we have the backing and partnerships to be successful! We have been developing our tech stack for 2.5 years. We consider ourselves as a Tech company that has built a finance product rather than a traditional FinTech. Especially at these challenging times, we’re on a mission to help SMEs. We streamline the application and servicing process for customers using state-of-the-art technology. We also use real-time data to create a more accurate picture and avoid the lengthy delays of traditional financers, all of which allows us to keep costs low and respond at lightning speed. At FIBR, we’re offering financing that’s as quick as the unsecured lenders, but as affordable as traditional lenders.

## A brief overview of what you’ll be doing

As a Product (UX/UI) Designer at FIBR,  you’ll be joining a small fast-moving team, so we’re looking for someone with a general appreciation of all things design across visual, experience, systems…

You’re comfortable taking the lead on early user research efforts, validating user pain points and the products we need to build. Our users include Founders, CEOs and CFOs, accountants and small business owners (to name a few) - we’re looking to create delightful, intuitive experiences for all of them.

We’re on the look-out for a motivated, analytical designer, with an aptitude for pixel-perfect layouts and experience with design systems.  You’re always focused on the customer, but balance this with technical constraints and business goals. You’ll have at least **3-5 years of experience**, ideally working in a start-up environment (fintech is a bonus!)

 ## Three reasons this role is great:

1. You’ll be following a UX process from ideation, wire-framing and prototyping, through testing, iteration and final design, you’ll help design mockups ranging from sketches to high fidelity prototypes in order to propose and evaluate how our product could best be improved.
2.  If you’re looking to take ownership in a highly driven team - this is the opportunity for you. We have big ambitions for growth, move at a fast pace, and you’ll work autonomously with the close support of startup founders and senior managers who have done this before.
3. You’ll make a difference - we’re building a business that will provide SMEs with the ability to build their own businesses, with our help.
 
## What will you do?

* Design interfaces for both web and mobile that are simple, elegant and easy to use. We want to make our users' lives easier.
* Contribute to the development of the FIBR brand identity and design system. 
* Partner with Product, Engineering, Risk, Ops and Marketing to work on the development of our MMP and website.
*  	You should have a good working knowledge of the best practices, tools and techniques across user-centred design, usability research and prototyping. You keep up-to-date with the latest trends in design and technology.
* You are experienced in product design, user interface and interaction design, visual design, storytelling, and prototyping.
* You’re happy to work collaboratively within a team but also solo.
* You understand that good design is not only about how things look, but how they work - it is more than fonts, colours and trends.
* You’re able to communicate design decisions and the rationale behind them throughout the company.
* You have a portfolio that displays your critical thinking and design excellence, both visual and product.
* You have empathy for customer needs, and you’re able to balance this with technical constraints and business goals.
* You are flexible; we’re a young startup and you’ll be designing lots of different things, fast.
* You’re a pro at Adobe XD and Figma, and have extensive experience with prototyping tools.
* You’re able to coordinate with and handover to engineers.
* You’re happy to conduct user research and usability testing to ensure all designs meet client and user requirements.
* You analyse all research and feedback to gain user insight – and incorporate this feedback into new designs.
* You’re passionate about solving problems and always identifying opportunities.
 
The nuts and bolts: 

* You must be comfortable with moving quickly from wireframe to pixel perfect and polished final designs.
* Excellent communication skills whether it be in person, zoom, phone or email or smoke signal.
* Smart, inquisitive, and have a willingness to sink your teeth into the role.
* A self-starter who takes initiative.
* Resilient to fast-changing requirements.
* Fintech experience is a bonus, but not a must-have!

 ## What will you get in return?

* Competitive Salary based on experience
* Employee Pension Contributions
*  A shiny new laptop
*  Keep healthy with Vitality Health Insurance 
* Generous leave policy (38 days leave, including bank holidays)
 
**As a young start up, we are still working on how we reward our team so watch this space for upcoming benefits and perks!**

 
## Sound like the right place for you? 

Yes? Great! Here’s the process:

*  Apply via the link or send us an email to careers@fibr.com with the link to your portfolio, your resume and why you’d like to join us in 300 words
* We will review the profiles we receive and for those that stand out, we will set-up some calls so we can find out more about each other
* If we think we could be a match, we’ll ask you to complete a task and meet with another member or two of our team. 
* And then, if you like us as much as we like you, we’ll make you an offer…  
* And you can start as soon as possible! Our new HR team is super excited to welcome you on board. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our user experience practice is growing and we’re seeking someone to join [SSE Energy](https://sse.co.uk/) and work on their digital smart meter service.

Our goal is to help customers better manage how much energy they use, and support the UK's effort to reduce carbon emissions. We need to better understand how people think about their lifestyles so we can offer services to help reduce their carbon footprint. The UK’s push to install smart meters is key to achieving this, enabling people to make better-informed decisions about how their homes consume energy. One of SSE Energy’s commercial objectives is to increase our number of smart meter installations; offering a compelling, intuitive, and effortless customer experience is crucial to this.

You’ll join the Smart Meters team and work closely with the product owner and engineers to help the team always ask: ""Are we building the right thing?”. The team covers all aspects of our smart meter offering: promotional content and customer education, sign-up and installation booking, and the in-life and support journeys. We’re looking for a generalist who leans towards research, and you’ll lead on discovery, usability studies, team workshops, and design.

You’ll also join the SSE Digital ux community, a small but close-knit group who align, work, and support one another closely 🙌

We’re keen to meet people with varied backgrounds: the more inclusive we are the better our work will be. We understand some people may not apply to jobs unless they tick every box. And we know 'normal' office hours don't work for everyone, so we're open to discussing flexible working requests. If you're excited about joining us and think you have much of what we're looking for, even if you're not 100% sure… we'd love to hear from you.

## Your objectives

* design and build tools which help our customers understand and take charge of their [**home energy and carbon footprint**](https://www.ovo.com/planzero/) — one of the biggest challenges in our industry

Boson Protocol is advancing the world of commerce by enabling enterprises, organisations, and customers to bridge the divide between digital decentralized technologies and the transfer and trade of physical goods. 

Our vision is for Boson to become the basic plumbing for dCommerce and its data on the emerging decentralized web, where the value captured is distributed equitably between token holders and protected from capture by a single centralized entity.

Simply applying Web2 principles to DeFi isn’t good enough, there are too many nuances for it to be that easy. You could argue that many eCommerce and traditional finance organisations are yet to grasp this properly, and we need to be a step ahead of them. This is where you come in.

## Must have skills and attributes
* Experience in UX design within Web3 / Crypto
* Hands on experience with using various UX and design tools
* Building storyboards 
* Mapping user journeys 
* Startup experience
* Be able to work in a remote, distributed team
 
## Benefits of working with us
* Work Remotely in a dynamic, young, fast growth startup
* The opportunity of working with bleeding edge technology
* Close collaboration with leading projects in the space, e.g. immediate deep dive into Ocean Protocol integration
* We offer a highly competitive salary and an attractive equity position. Details depend on ability and experience. Come and talk to us.
* Flexible working schedule
 
## Some of our guiding principles 
* **Dream Big**: We want to build technology that can outlast the founders and reshape commerce and society at large
* **Self-Mastery**: Mindful conduct and always on learning are critical components of personal and collective growth
* **Collaboration**: Expertise is key, but sharing knowledge and building together with joy is the foundation of truly remarkable work
* **Stay lean**: Our ethos is to create and share value equitably, with minimal value extraction.

If you would like to be part of the foundational change in how we view commerce, then we would love to talk to you about the dCommerce revolution.

## About us
addmustard is a full service, digital marketing agency that works with entrepreneurial businesses to help them to grow efficiently. Put simply, we’re built for entrepreneurs, by entrepreneurs. Our amazingly talented team is made up of those people who do more, think more, and act more (and quite often, celebrate more…) and we are fascinated by the kind of people who get a kick out of delivering something great. Our team has many years of in-house experience with clients, so we understand the pressures and take the responsibility of helping our clients grow their businesses incredibly seriously.

Essentially, we want to attract great people and keep them. And attract great clients and keep them.

Simple, right? That’s where you come in.

## Who we’re looking for

Regardless of whether you get your kicks from a night in with a GA dashboard or you’re an authority on acquisition, addmustard is built from individuals who love a challenge. For the most part, we don’t just work with our entrepreneurial clients on individual campaigns or channels, but we immerse ourselves deeply into their businesses and work alongside them to solve fundamental commercial and digital challenges. Which means we need people who love to get right to the nub of a problem and ask the questions that others are avoiding, as well as offering the solutions that have yet to be thought of. We’ve built (and are very proud of) our completely flat and integrated organisational structure –we don’t care where the good ideas come from, as long as they can be turned into something amazing and tangible.

So, if any of the following sound like you, it’s probably time we organised a beer and a chat.

* You genuinely care about delivering results
* You think outside the box… is a complete cliché (but do it anyway)
* You’re an expert in your field, but also love to look holistically across all channels and campaigns
* You’re hands on and not afraid to get stuck in
* You’re a passionate problem solver
* You’re dynamic
* You’re looking for a working environment where the whole team loves coming to work, supports each other and feels relaxed

In return for your experience, creativity and incredible mind, we’ll make sure you work with and are trained by industry experts at the forefront of digital marketing. Our senior management is open, honest and transparent which means we regularly share financial, team, and client performance with the whole agency. You can choose the hours you work, provided they fit with our team and clients’ requirements, and you’ll enjoy a bi-annual training budget, generous pension scheme, free gym membership, and ride-to-work scheme.

We're leading the way by funding critical research, improving healthcare and treatment so we can reach our vision of a world where diabetes can do no harm.

Diabetes UK staff are motivated and experienced and extremely passionate about helping people affected by diabetes.  We have been fighting for people with diabetes for more than 80 years and changed millions of lives thanks to the new treatments, technology and policy changes we've been behind.

But there's more to do.  And you can be part of it.

We're a diverse bunch and as a charity we recognise and respect the value of everyone.

We've recently been awarded a One Star Accreditation status by Best Companies.  And this year we were named 65th in the top 100 not-for-profit organisations in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For list. 

We're committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, young people and adults at risk and expect all staff and volunteers to actively support this commitment.

We have a vision of a world where diabetes can do no harm.  If you’d like to be part of that, why not join us?

We're looking for a UX Designer - someone obsessed about UX design principles and best practices, creating seamless experiences that engage and delight our customers.  

 This role focuses on the Sportsbook products enjoyed by customers when they bet online, in app or mobile on sporting events. It's a chance for you to develop your curiosity for service design within the online betting space, and understand how this affects the solutions to problems, and inevitably the products that you design.

 We take the safety and wellbeing of our employees seriously, especially at this challenging time. We have put in place robust Covid19 measures and are supporting our new employees with a smooth remote onboarding and training programme to make you feel welcome and part of our team. We offer a balanced approach to office and home working - now and for the long term future. 

## About us
We make a huge investment in everyone, offering great career development opportunities. Our people are at the heart of everything we do and we offer a fast-paced environment where we have fun, celebrate success and give you all the tools you’ll need to be your best self. It’s not just our colleagues we look after – we’ve got a responsibility to our customers too, and so we work hard on our ambition to allow no harm to occur from gambling. When the fun stops, stop.

 ## Your role in the team
We engage our stakeholders at every point of the design journey, so you'll partner with product management, development and design ensuring that the delivery teams are clear about objectives and missions. You'll interpret briefs and requirements into user stories, use cases and acceptance criteria for clarity between yourself and product owners.

To be truly agile, it's essential that we work collaboratively across teams, being the all-important link between user needs and business objectives. Your multi-disciplinary squad will focus on specific customer journeys within William Hill Sportsbook technology products, setting a benchmark for what good looks like, and how to get there. You'll be able to research customer pain points and validate designs not just with our customers but also with our William Hill colleagues too.

 Working alongside experts in UX, UI, Research, and commercial teams, you'll ensure our business obligations are met whilst never compromising on the user experience. This truly is a truly unique opportunity to help innovate and drive change within a fast paced and ever-changing industry alongside team mates in the UK and Gibraltar, all creating memorable (but responsible) experiences for customers.

 ## Skills needed
Your portfolio needs to demonstrate evidence of your understanding of User Centred Design methodologies for both Web, and Native. Our subject matter (betting and gaming) is our passion, so ideally you'll bring experience in a similar global sports, betting, gaming, media or entertainment company and/or agency (but this is not essential). You'll need to be an expert in working within a design system and utilising pattern libraries for speed and efficiency. You'll have the confidence to analyse evidence and knowledge of user behaviours and heuristics, and needs to define product and experience strategies for retail.

 Of course it's vital that you have experience in a variety of UX and design tools. A working knowledge of Figma would be beneficial to hit the ground running. You must genuinely thrive on UX work, and you know just when to add an extra level of intricate Motion/Interaction to your solutions to heighten user joy. Having some UI skills will be useful, but if you're looking to focus only on UI, this isn't the role for you. 

It's important that you're confident working within the agile scrum framework to ensure the smooth handover of deliverables. You'll also need to be familiar with both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies to help drive solutions, and will also understand the benefits to working directly with an independent research team.

Be an outstanding communicator. With your depth of skills and knowledge you’re not afraid to voice your opinion, after all you always have data and insight on your side. Your strong interpersonal skills will also help you convey complex systematic design requirements clearly within the organisation and build strong and collaborative relationships with your stakeholders.

 ## Application instructions
We need to see an impressive online portfolio that demonstrates your UX design talent. Please include the url in your application alongside your CV. No application will be considered without this.

 ## What we offer
We’ll welcome you on-board with 25 days holiday (not to mention 8 bank holidays and an extra day for your birthday), healthcare, an attractive pension package and life assurance.

 ## William Hill in London
We couldn’t be closer to the action in our London office. A 2-minute walk from Tottenham Court Road station, round the corner from Soho and Oxford Street means you’ll never be short of anywhere to go for a lunchtime stroll or a post-work drink.

We work closely with some of the UK’s favourite brands like Argos and eBay, along with 100’s of other partners from retail to travel and everything in-between.  

We’re on a mission to reimagine the future of loyalty. Think personalised offers and playful experiences. Our customers are ever more app-engaged, and we’re excited about the possibilities that brings. Join us and make life a little sweeter for millions of people across the UK.

 ## What you’ll do

You’ll approach things in a balanced way, considering outcomes, design principles, analytics, customer insight and business requirements.

 ## About you 
* A portfolio that shows that you love design – if you’ve worked for a large brand that’s a bonus! 
* Interactions and animations make you jump with joy – you’re able to think beyond static designs and bring your work to life

* We believe that good design is for everyone and you should too – you’re passionate about inclusivity and you know your way around accessibility standards

* Being organised makes you happy – whether it’s Notion, Notes or notebooks

* You bring yourself to work every day – we’ll love you for who you are! 

 ## Decisions you’ll make 
We’re big on autonomy and you’ll be trusted to make design decisions that create the best ever experiences for millions of customers 

## What you’ll use 
You’ll get a MacBook Pro with access to Figma, Miro, Principle and UserZoom 

 ## Application good to knows 
To be considered we’ll need to see your previous work. We’re interested in your whole process; how you approach problems, generate ideas, test with customers, push around pixels and iterate on what you’ve put out into the world. 

You don’t need to worry about having a fancy website that you’ve built yourself – although if you do that’s great. You can use Google Slides or put together a PDF – it’s totally ok. What’s most important is that you’re showing your work clearly and thoughtfully. 

Worried your experience doesn’t quite match? We’d encourage you to drop us a message or go ahead and apply anyway – we like to keep an open mind. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Care about doing a great job and exceeding expectations with the quality of what you do
True team player who sees things through end to end

So if you are excited about working with us and think you can do much of what we are looking for but aren’t sure if you are 100% there yet… why not give it a whirl? Please note that sometimes we may close a job earlier for applications if we are inundated with amazing candidates.. Good luck!*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grafana has over 5.3M users, so improving the product and different parts of its experience will have a massive impact. A lot of other systems integrate with Grafana and there are many points where this can be a challenging experience, especially for new users.

* You know how to transform insights into ideas – you are able to **prototype and validate them by yourself**, through further research or** usability testing**. You are able to communicate those ideas clearly and are solid in written and spoken English.
* You have a good understanding of accessibility in web solutions and have experience **designing solutions that follow accessibility standards**.
* You enjoy working on **complex solutions** – Grafana is a highly technological solution and has avid followers who rely on it every day and care deeply about their workflows.

**Please note that this advert is posted for several Senior User Experience & Design opportunities across D+E. So, if your application is shortlisted and we interview you, we can best recommend the product or area that you'll initially join**

If you’ve ever seen or heard some BBC content on a digital device, we almost certainly designed it – be it breaking news, football scores, the latest drama on iPlayer, or asking Alexa to play Radio 6music. We also design the ‘behind the scenes’ employee experiences to help make these happen. Our ace team of UX designers, architects, writers and researchers collaborate closely with product, editorial and technical teams right across the BBC to do this. 

To learn more about UX&D at the BBC follow this link to our website called GEL (Global Experience Language) and check out some of our videos with the teams:

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/articles/about-bbc-uxd](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/articles/about-bbc-uxd)

## Main Responsibilities
* Be the voice of the user in project teams, explaining your rationale to developers, editorial staff and product managers
* Collaborate with other members of User Experience & Design to get to the heart of what our users need: creating sketches, concepts, user journeys, wireframes, and navigational prototypes
* Engage the wider team and key stakeholders in the user-centred design process, ensuring that user research is at the heart of design decision making
* Input into recruitment and development of mid-weight and junior staff, including regular catch-ups, professional development, input into appraisals, and manage poor performance where required
* Work with people across UX&D to make sure we’re making the most of the BBC’s Global Experience Language (GEL)
* Instigate projects, prioritise your own workload, and plan the work of other UX colleagues in your team
* Guide the work of external agencies and freelancers to learn new things, see new perspectives and collaborate on new ideas
* Help organise formal user research and proactively try out ideas and designs with people on the street to make sure we’re meeting real user needs
* Support a positive working environment that considers the needs of a diverse team

## Are you the right candidate?
Our Senior UX roles encompass the fields of Designer, Information Architect, Writer, and Design Researcher. For this particular position, we’re looking for strong skills in interaction design, visual design, creative facilitation, branding and typography.

Service design is a growth area, and we welcome those with the skills and curiosity to understand the why, what and how of people and make sure that’s communicated effectively. Or maybe you've got something special up your sleeve, like top skills in illustration, motion graphic design or prototype building. Our team's made up of a diverse range of people, skills, and experience, so we'd love to hear about you and yours. 

Your portfolio is full of consistently great work across different screens and experiences – be they on mobile, connected TV, tablet, desktop or connected device. Now you're ready to take all that experience and expertise and use it to inspire others. Yes, you can craft delightful designs. But you know improving user experiences isn't just about grafting away at the drawing board. You take a broader view – approaching design conceptually and thinking about the whole experience across multiple screens and touchpoint.

Whether you learned your skills on a design degree or on the job, you're comfortable using them to explain design concepts to anyone, no matter how senior or inexperienced. And you know how to balance what the user needs with what's really achievable. You're enthusiastic, curious and full of ideas. You keep up to speed with the latest design trends and technology developments. And you’re constantly fascinated by what people really need, and how we can create the right experience for them.C

At the Government Digital Service (GDS), our mission is to build a simple, joined-up and personalised experience of government for everyone. Using our unique position at the centre of government, we develop services that work for the user, however complex the underlying systems may be. We believe that ensuring things work for end users is the only way to realise the efficiencies that come with digital transformation.

Our focus is on delivering five missions in the following areas:
1. GOV.UK as the single and trusted online destination for government information and services
2. Joined-up services that solve whole problems and span multiple departments
3. A simple digital identity solution that works for everyone
4. Common tools and expert services
5. Joined-up data across departments

You can read more about these missions and our vision for the transformation of government in our [2021-2024 strategy](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2021/05/20/government-digital-service-our-strategy-for-2021-2024/)

## What you'll do
GDS is hiring user researchers to support our exciting and ambitious strategy. We are looking for several user researchers to join us across the board, in the GOV.UK, Digital Identity and Government as a Platform (GaaP) teams.

User Researchers are key figures in the teams that design and deliver services. They help their teams develop a deep understanding of the people - citizens, businesses or government colleagues - who use a service. Their findings allow their teams to design and build better services more quickly and at lower cost and risk. And to continuously improve services, based on data and evidence.

As a User Researcher you will work in a multi-disciplinary team on a wide range of user research activities. You will work independently, with support and guidance from more senior user researchers.

As a User Researcher at GDS you'll:
* plan, design and prepare a range of user research activities to support the design, development and continuous improvement of government services.
* carry out user research activities from recruiting participants, preparing discussion guides and moderating research sessions.
* lead colleagues to analyse research data and synthesise clear and actionable findings, including working closely with analytics colleagues to create a rich picture of user behaviour.
* communicate user research findings to help the team and wider organisation develop a deep understanding of users and their needs - including presentations at show and tells, designing and maintaining research outputs and creating formal reports.
* work closely with product managers, designers and developers to turn user research findings into stories and actions that lead to valuable product and service features
* mentor and guiding more junior user researchers
* contribute to the wider user research community - including presenting at meetups and writing blog posts

## Who you are
We're interested in people who have:
* experience and understanding of a range of user centred service design and delivery practices.
* the ability to understand what problem your team is trying to solve, and align user research activities to inform decision making and action.
* experience and understanding of a range of user research methods, when to use those methods and how to apply them correctly.
* experience and understanding of a range of techniques for analysis of research data, synthesis of findings, and presentation of clear findings that colleagues can understand and use.
* a good understanding of the diversity of users of government services, and the ability to include many kinds of users in appropriate research activities.
* experience of working with colleagues to plan and do continuous user research in a multidisciplinary team.
* experience of involving your team in research activities, and in analysis and synthesis.
* a good understanding of the social and technological context for government services, and the ability to align user research activities to help their team understand changing user behaviour.
* understanding of agile approaches.
* some knowledge of current technologies used to build and operate digital services, and the different technical roles in a digital team.

* Those looking to embrace and learn about hypothesis-driven, iterative product design processes
* Collaborative designers that work together with other team members to collaborate over the problem solving process
* Detail-focused craftspeople, with a mix of design thinking and practical skills, along with an eye for visual design

You do this by taking rough sketches, lo-fidelity wireframes and adapting, with the support of your peers, to a production (or client) ready deliverable.

You generate multiple solutions, and with guidance, choose the most appropriate based on a user-focused rationale, being able to visualize, explain, and evaluate your thinking from the perspective of the user at the appropriate fidelity.

You’ll have many opportunities for growth and learning: collaboration within teams, rotation to different products, experimentation on internal tools, involvement in new business and pitching, our Potato Talks events, mentorship, training courses, and conferences.

## About the role
We are looking for a highly collaborative UX designer to join the Museum on a 12-month contract to develop, launch and iterate on exciting new products.

Clarks, based in Somerset, England, has been at the forefront of innovative shoemaking since its foundation in 1825, when brothers James and Cyrus Clark made a slipper from sheepskin off-cuts.

In the Clarks archive of more than 22,000 pairs are shoes that have sparked revolutions and defined generations. From the original Clarks Desert Boot, first designed by Nathan Clark and launched in 1950 to the iconic Wallabee, each design has an instantly recognisable signature – a unique combination of craftsmanship and innovation that make it unmistakably Clarks.

At Perlego, we’re working hard to make education accessible to all. In this digital age, we believe that anyone should be able to learn anything at any time. Knowledge should be more accessible, not locked behind sky-high price tags.

Over the past 4 years our goal has been to support students across the UK & Europe to access quality books. The next stage of Perlego is two fold: 1) expand our support to students globally, and 2) build a product that goes beyond the book, a platform that helps students study smarter and more effectively.

## What we’re looking for
A Product Designer with experience in designing beautifully crafted interfaces and world-class product experiences. As part of our design team, you'd be working on every stage of the design process, from research to delivery. You'd also be joining one of our cross-functional development squads as their product owner, prioritising initiatives and streamlining execution.

## How we work together
We organise ourselves into cross-functional squads, with each squad working together on a common product goal. Each squad generally consists of 7 team members - a Technical Lead, 3 Engineers, a QA Engineer, a DevOps Engineer, and you.

## What you’ll do
1. Shape solutions: develop a deep understanding of our users’ goals, workflows, pain points and work with product managers and developers to identify and shape key initiatives that meet the quarter's objectives.
2. Design best-in-class experiences: take on responsibility for the design process, from research to prototyping and creating delightfully simple experiences for our users.
3. Definition requirements: write user stories and ensure that the work to come is ready to be taken into development.
4. Support the development squad: work collaboratively with our engineering team to deliver your solutions. Oversee the development stages and evaluate progress, providing design reviews and guidance and defining if a product/feature meets requirements and is ready for release.
5. Manage the backlog: manage and maintain a healthy backlog of work for the squad. You'll collaborate with product managers to prioritise and identify risks and dependencies, working with appropriate people to address them.
6. Act as liaison: encourage co-operation and exchange of information between the squad and the wider product team and company. Work with external team members to gain insights, buy-in and to provide clear instructions and deliverables for the developers.

## Requirements
It’s the perfect role for you if you have:

* An insatiable passion for digital design and the latest trends.
* Strong visual skills, creative thinking and design background. Detail-oriented, always striving for quality and consistency.
* Strong portfolio (with product design experience)
* 3+ years of work experience designing digital products for web and mobile platforms.
* Proficiency with UI design tools, such as Figma, Sketch or XD.
* Proficiency with prototyping tools, such as Figma, InVision or Framer X.
* Ability to own a design process from start to finish from workshops, user testing and UX research to creating first class final designs and handovers to development teams.
* Passion about building and delivering products that solve real user needs, working closely with a team of engineers to make this happen.
* Interest in analysing data to make informed design decisions and to test your theories.
* Experience with working in a cross-functional domain, collaborating with people from multiple disciplines and backgrounds
* Experience working in an ambiguous domain - you don't always have all the answers you find feasible ways to validate your ideas with a results-oriented and experimental approach.
* Great communication skills - you can communicate hypothesis, findings and ideas to stakeholders at all levels, in different shapes depending on the context.
* Good leadership, people management and relationship building skills.
* Energy, passion and a sleeves-rolled-up mentality: think quick, act fast and measure later.

⭐️ It’s a plus if you have:

* Advanced experience with user research and testing
* Experience working with research and data to drive decision making
* Experience with Agile and/or Scrum
* Experience in a startup environment and/or MA (or equivalent) in Business / Entrepreneurship
* Have a general interest in books, reading and always learning new things!

So if you are excited about working with us and think you can do much of what we are looking for but aren’t sure if you are 100% there yet… why not give it a whirl?

As we do this from scratch we have complete responsibility for each product: developing the backend, the front-end, the data science infrastructure, and then creating a local setup in each country with scalable risk management and portfolio management solutions.
The team is made up of a mix of risk management, product, design and software professionals, providing lots of opportunity to share knowledge and learnings across functions.


## About The Role
We’re looking for talented Product Designers to join our Credit Department. If you genuinely love what you do, are driven and passionate, then we want to hear from you.

At Revolut, each product team operates independently like a mini-startup, with its own tech and design resources. This not only allows for fast-paced development and pivots, it facilitates passionate, close-knit teams that work closely together to achieve their goals. 

## What You Need To Achieve
We don’t follow the traditional corporate model, but empower our people to own their work end-to-end, that’s what you’ll be in charge of in your Product team: lead the product from a design perspective, having a holistic approach on the experience, from discovery to delivery - always keeping in mind our customers and their interests!

* You will be partnering with the Product Owners, Engineers, Data Scientists, and other colleagues, working in a cross-functional and distributed team. Together, you will be actively involved in defining the customers’ and the business’ problems.
* You’ll identify the key metrics for the projects you are involved in and take ownership for achieving their success.
* You will research and bring forward new findings and learnings for reaching complex company goals - such as launching in new territories and offering new products.
* From wire-framing to designing end-to-end flows and prototypes, you will be in charge of designing products that solve problems in a simple and elegant way while taking care of every small detail.
* We love turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution that truly solves customer needs, thus you will be running user testing workshops and guerrilla testing;
* Once that’s done, iterate, implement with the technical team and present the final solution during the design reviews;
* We are not stopping here, we believe in continuous improvement, so you’ll review the performance of the release, identify learnings and find ways to enhance it.
* To ensure we are speaking the same language as a team, we have the support of a design system - so you’ll kick in!

## What You'll Need
* 3+ years of experience in designing world-class complex commercial apps
* A portfolio featuring examples of product design work
* Strong design skills across iOS, Android and web platforms
* The ability to think at a high level about product strategy and clearly articulate design decisions
* The ability to understand technical implications in their design decisions
* The ability to take ownership of design process and work as self-directed member of the development team
* Strong UX focus and understanding of human behaviour
* Clean visual design sense
* Skills in typography and grids
* Love to solve problems and be challenged
* To be a constant learner. You will be always growing - both personally and with the team

A little about us…When Revolut was founded in 2015, we had a vision to build a sustainable, digital alternative to traditional big banks. Our mission now is to help our customers improve their financial health, empower them to have more control, and promote financial cohesion across the communities in which we operate. Launching into 2020 with 10 million Personal customers and over a quarter of a million Business customers only reinforced our belief in the vast need across the world for better financial services. As our customer base has boomed in the last year, we’ve expanded our team to match that growth. We started 2019 with several hundred employees; we closed it out with 2000.

What we’re looking for…Revolut is being scaled up by people all around the world who share our vision. We’re looking for people who align with our five core values: we believe that we Get it Done because we Think Deeper and are strongly rooted in the Dream Team. We Never Settle hence why we always Deliver Wow. You want to join a community of forward thinking people - we are here for you. We believe in empowering our Revoluters in their work, giving them autonomy and ownership of what they do. We want everyone at Revolut to own their story and their successes - working with us means you’re not just another cog in the machine.

* Proven track record creating design languages for multichannel application experiences.
* Strong research skills that demonstrate an awareness of user and business goals that compel you to imagine, illustrate and help realize compelling functional interfaces.
* Confidence in employing skills across all stages of the design and development process, including conception, design, standardization, specification and enforcement.
* Keen eye for detail and micro interactions across all aspects of design, and a focus on the quality of end products.
* Curiosity and resourcefulness balanced with the ability to learn and operate within the complex business domains of the company.
* Ability to skillfully represent the UX design discipline within a multidisciplinary product team and when presenting to stakeholders, sponsors and critics.
* Commitment and self-motivation suitable for a start-up team (“This is not my job” isn’t your in vocabulary).
* Expertise in your craft balanced with a desire to stay up to date on the latest design trends and applications.
* Team player with a positive attitude who enjoys collaborating to achieve design goals, while remaining comfortable taking and giving feedback to reach the best solutions.

This is an amazing opportunity to be a Product Designer at Oxford Medical Simulation. You will be responsible for solving complex design problems with beautiful, simple solutions in a platform that crosses internal and external web applications and virtual reality experiences.

You might be:
* leading a design on a brand new product
* designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple
* advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.

Because of you, OMS is delivering more training, more quickly, to those that need it in healthcare and healthcare education. 

You're doing this because you have an incredible and wide skill set and want to make as broad an impact as possible.

Are you ready for your next challenge?

## Who you are
* You are iterative in your design process and approach
* Keen to validate your ideas early
* Thoughtful and intentional in seeking and responding to feedback. 
* You move fast, listen, and adapt.
* You are adept at giving and receiving critiques.
* You can build great relationships with the wider team and can convey your design rationale to them using a variety of methods including presenting your mockups, making prototypes, sharing a design spec etc.
* You are comfortable with uncertainty - many of the design challenges we face have not been tackled before - you will be leading the way
* You know that form informs function and usability—that the surface layer doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Your design decisions are often informed by—and will influence—engineering and business considerations.
* You love new technology and want to be part of a team using cutting edge tech for good
* You are dedicated to the user experience and making their lives better

## What you will be doing
* **Interaction and visual design**. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with mockup and prototyping tools.
* **User research**. You will be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics.
* **Prototyping**. You will prototype both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.
* **Partnering with the wider team**. You will work hand in hand with the rest of the product and clinical team throughout development.
* **Designing a range of products** - both internal and external facing
* **Awareness of how software interfaces are built**. Familiarity with HTML, CSS and Javascript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert—just fluent enough to collaborate with our talented engineering team, and know what's possible with frontend technologies.

## Job Introduction
Are you interested in creating design systems that support BBC News, Sport, and the children’s experiences?  Do you want to be working alongside top-class engineers to bring both order and delight to our vast and diverse audience? And are you up for solving difficult problems at scale? 

The Global Experience Language (more commonly known as GEL), is the BBC’s shared design framework. Along with the Core Services team, we are working to measurably improve the way teams create the next generation of digital experiences at the BBC. 

Providing a consistent User Experience (UX) across many BBC services is vitally important. For our audiences, GEL provides ease of use, familiarity, and the confidence to explore more of our digital content. For our design and engineering teams, GEL increases our efficiency and productivity.

You can read about some of the design system challenges we’re solving in[ this article by our talented designers and engineers.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/articles/creating-a-design-system-for-bbc)

The opportunities we have are in the core GEL space and also Core Services.  

## Main Responsibilities
* Be the voice of GEL in project teams, explaining your design rationale to Engineers, Editorial and Product teams.
* Lead the central Core Services UX approach. Helping to create a new more centralised way of working across many teams.
* Evolve our design system to be the best in class and meet the needs of our audiences.
* Collaborate with other members of UX&D across the country to get to the heart of what our users need, creating sketches, concepts, user journeys, wireframes, and prototypes.
* Inspire and encourage UX&D colleagues to create coherent user experiences across many screens and platforms.
* Lead the development of the visual and interaction elements of BBC user experiences, refining them towards a polished design, considering typography, iconography, layout, and brand identity along the way.
* Line manage, mentor and develop colleagues, inspiring them to new creative heights.
* Instigate projects you see as important and prioritise your own workload.
* Guide the work of external agencies and freelancers to learn new things, see new perspectives and create new ideas.
* Help organise formal user research and try out ideas and designs with people on the street to make sure we’re meeting real user needs.
* Do all this with a view to achieving a single, seamless service on all screens across all BBC products.

## Are you the right candidate?
Your portfolio's full of great work across different screens, be it mobile, connected TV, tablet, or desktop. Now you're ready to take all that experience and expertise and use it to inspire others.

You have an understanding of the challenges and opportunities that come with building and creating design systems. Great design systems don’t happen in a vacuum - You’ve got the experience of both getting people to understand the value, and bringing them along on the journey

Yes, you can craft delightful designs. But you know improving user experiences isn't just about grafting away at the drawing board. You take a broader view - approaching design conceptually and thinking about the whole experience across multiple screens with a system-based approach.

You’ve got examples of where you have introduced, implemented, or improved a design system. That might have been from the ground up, or maybe you helped to make it real via design tooling. You might tend towards wireframes, user flows and personas. Or layout, colour, and typography. And maybe you've got something special up your sleeve like you're a top illustrator, motion graphic designer or front-end prototype builder. Our teams are made up of a diverse range of people, skills, and experience, so we'd love to hear about you and yours.

Whether you learned your skills on a design degree or on the job, you're comfortable using them to explain design concepts to anyone, no matter how senior or inexperienced. And you know how to balance what the user needs with what's achievable. You're enthusiastic, curious, and full of ideas.

You keep up to speed with the latest design trends and technology developments. And you’re constantly fascinated by what people really need, and how we can create the right experience to give it to them.

Senior Product UX/UI Designer (70% UX / 30% UI)

## Role Overview
Working in the Global Technology team, creating advanced innovative internal products for our client teams across the media line of business. The role is a hybrid product UX role with a focus on the UX side (70% UX / 30% Design).

The purpose of this role is to design interactive experiences, with all consideration given to the user and usability best practices and the balancing of those with business goals and technical capabilities.

As the Senior UX Designer you will be involved in scoping, designing and evolving a brand-new platform of apps, that strikes a balance between the internal user needs and requirements, and objectives of the business. This role offers a unique opportunity to be part of a new product team, working to shape and influence a product from the early stages.

The Senior UX Designer will have in-depth UCD (User-centred Design) experience working on complex products — preferably in the enterprise tooling/ platform space. Any experience in designing tools with a workflow/ service design angle too is advantageous. The designer will be a true team player; flexible, positive and a willingness to collaborate in varying sized groups — teaming with others from different disciplines. Their attitude and approach to tackling design challenges are probably the most important aspects of this role.

The designer will have worked on projects from inception through to research, testing and delivery. We are seeking candidates who happily get their hands stuck into creating and iterating core UX design deliverables, whether it be user journeys, task flows, system/site mapping, concepts, wireframes or lean prototypes – depending on the challenge at hand.

They will be advocates of a considered design process, yet flexible enough to adapt their approach to deliver artefacts in as lean a manner as possible, in order drive the product forward.

## Key Accountabilities 
* Excellent UX skills across the UCD spectrum, working experience and advocates of evidence-based design decision-making through research and observation.
* In-depth knowledge and evidence via portfolio/case studies of having worked with data, testing, research and analytics
* At least 1 years experience working on SaaS style platforms in a previous role. Proven product/platform design experience is a must for this role.
* 6+ years industry experience working within a digital process/function, either client or agency-side (or preferably a combination).
* Experienced and able to work in each of the stages of product design from discovery and research to design, test and measuring the impact of said solution/idea.
* Experience working with Agile, Lean UX methodologies and concept of MVP.
* Experience or awareness of media (offline/digital media highly advantageous, but not essential).
* Ability to clearly and effectively communicate design processes, ideas, and solutions to teams and internal stakeholders.
* Experience and understanding of design system thinking.
* Basic understanding of Front End technologies: HTML, CSS, REACT, JavaScript would be an added bonus.
* Worked with Product Managers, the business and technical teams to determine different approaches to support business solutions.
* Strong experience in prototyping; including experience with tools like Axure & InVision.
* Excellent core UX/IA-driven skills. This is not a Visual design role.
* We are keen to see portfolios which have detailed examples of concepts, research, prototyping, testing and measurement.

* Clearly elaborate and communicate rationales for design decisions.
* Iterate based on user research and feedback from the whole team.
* Work closely with engineers as they build and ship ideas.
* See both the forest and the trees: think big picture, execute fine details.
* Plan for the long term while navigating short-term tradeoffs.
* Work collaboratively with product, engineering, customer success and marketing.
* Proactively make new product or feature idea proposals and iteratively enhance the design process.

The core skills we are looking for are as follows, with bonus points on offer to help you really stand out from the pack:

## Job Description
We’re looking for an experienced UX Researcher/Designer to help us integrate a new feature into our **CCleaner Cloud** product.

CCleaner Cloud is a cloud-based version of our popular Desktop optimisation tool that is aimed at businesses to make their computers run faster, perform better and last longer from any connected device. Users of CCleaner Cloud are typically IT managers looking to manage and optimise all the computers in their organisation.

A “Software Updater” feature (which exists on the Desktop app) is being considered for integration after requests from customers but there is still uncertainty about how best to solve the customer’s problem. This project would involve research to help determine for example, the level of detail or control that would be needed by our customers to best meet their needs. Another consideration would be the software titles that customers would expect to be included in the list of available software to update.

Once the research establishes a direction, UX documentation would be required to help direct the Product Design and Development.

## Project Responsibilities
* Collaborate with the Product Manager, CCleaner Cloud Developers and the UXD Team to understand the user needs, technical requirements and to meet the business goals
* Conduct Research to understand the customer need for a “Software Updater” feature
* Design the UX to specify the integration of the feature
* Depending on scope of work specified (considering confidence on meeting needs, any risks, technical practicalities etc), if required, plan phases of the project with appropriate roadmaps

## Requirements
* At least 3 years solid track record of UX Design experience
* Outstanding portfolio (website, pdf etc) demonstrating a commercial track record of UX Research and UX Design
* Collaborative, articulate and open communication style, comfortable writing and speaking (in English) with designers, colleagues in other disciplines and senior stakeholders
* Experience working on SASS, business and/or technical products would be a bonus

## About Us
**CCleaner@Avast** is the world’s most popular optimisation tool, with over 2.5 billion downloads across 195 countries. Available on PC, Mac and Android, we’re on a mission to make devices run faster and last longer, while protecting our users’ privacy and security. CCleaner is one of several smaller businesses acquired by Avast in 2017.

Sounds exciting? We look forward to hearing from you.

## Job Description
As the UK’s largest insurer, a FTSE 100 company and a global leader in our industry, our Technology teams are crucial to our success. We truly believe our Technology community is amongst the most talented and supportive anywhere. Without their skills and ideas, we wouldn’t be the company we are today.  But we’re not the kind of organisation that gets complacent. We want to keep investing in our technology, and more importantly, we want to keep investing in the people behind our technology.   

That’s why our Graduate jobs are permanent from day one.  

**Technology careers for diverse Graduates** New insights, perspectives and diversity of thought are all invaluable to us. Which is why you don’t need to have studied IT previously to join us in Technology. We have Graduates that have studied everything from Music to Maths, from Business Studies to History, and they’re all equally brilliant.   We have a real variety of roles across our technology teams. As long as you’re curious and passionate about technology, then we can teach you the rest – you’ll have a structured training programme and a support network to help you develop.  

**User Experience (UX) Design** is a design process that focusses on designing user interfaces that offer a great experience to its users. From how people access our websites and apps, to their usability and accessibility, it’s our UX teams that are responsible for this. They build a bridge to the customer, helping us to better understand, and fulfil their needs and expectations.   

**As a Graduate User Experience Designer** you will either be based in Norwich or London and will champion the customer and pursue every opportunity to ensure that we’re delivering digital products that address true customer needs.

You’ll be working on interesting and challenging initiatives alongside a community of highly skilled and experienced technology professionals who will be on hand to support and encourage you every step of the way. This is a brilliant learning environment – a place where everyone is welcome to share ideas, ask questions and seek out advice. Where you’ll be based: We offer our Graduate User Experience (UX) roles in our Norwich or London offices.   At Aviva we ask our teams to think about when they work in the office and when they work at home. This will vary depending on your role. We call this SMART working. When you join us, your leader will take time to discuss this with you and to agree what works for you, your team and the organisation.

### Summary
The first duty of Government is to protect the public. Since 1782, the Home Office has led work to keep the country safe from those who seek to do it harm; in doing so, we make a vital contribution to HM Government’s plan for a stronger, fairer, outward-looking and united Britain.

The Home Office covers three systems: Homeland Security, Public Safety and Borders, and Immigration and Citizenship. These systems work collaboratively to deliver our cross-cutting priorities, whilst providing increasingly efficient and secure services for the public.

Digital Data and Technology (DDaT) enables the Home Office to keep citizens safe and the country secure, as well as at the front line of making the Home Office a modern and capable department at a time of unprecedented global change.

Within DDaT, Data Services and Analytics (DSA) runs one of the most advanced data analytics centres in Government. This sits at the heart of the Home Office’s transformation into a data-driven Department.

In DSA, we design, build and operate services that are critical in helping the Department achieve its mission. You will be responsible for helping build and deliver business-critical analytical data products used across the Home Office. Our success depends on our ability to exploit the latest technologies to create leading-edge, world class solutions whilst ensuring they are secure and resilient.

### Job description
This key leadership role requires an exceptional individual to put user-centred design at the forefront of the Home Office’s digital transformation. We need you to help make sure our services work for everyone, by default.

A strong influencer, you’ll play a key role in managing, developing and supporting DDaT staff across the department. You’ll also set the direction for what good looks like in a large government department.

You’ll use your leadership experience to coordinate user researchers across the department, and represent your professional community to service teams, stakeholders and senior management.

You’ll also be a central figure in the cross-government user research community, sharing your experience, ideas and understanding of best practice with colleagues in other departments.

In line with much of the private sector you’ll be in post as Head of Role for 2 years. You will then move to an operational role where we will want you to continue your positive impact on our transformation, making the most of what you’ve learned.

As Head of User Research, you’ll define principles, processes and standards to ensure all Home Office services are accessible, inclusive and meet user needs. You’ll also build capability and consistency through regular peer reviews and the Research Ethics Board.

You’ll ensure user researchers work closely with content designers and interaction designers to define user needs and make evidence-based decisions. You’ll empower them to challenge assumptions, by supporting their research findings, and explaining the impact of those findings to senior management.

To promote quality and consistency, you’ll ensure that user researchers follow the GDS Service Manual and assess services against the Digital Service Standard.

This post is eligible for DDaT RRA. Successful candidates with exceptional skills and experience may apply for a Recruitment Retention Allowance between £3000 and £9000. This allowance is subject to an initial review within six months of taking up the post and thereafter an annual review in line with departmental priorities and could be reduced or withdrawn at any time.

### Responsibilities
Your main day to day responsibilities will include:
* Working with stakeholders at all levels to raise awareness and visibility of what good user research and user-centred design looks like, and drive positive change.
* Working with the Deputy Director for Research and Design and the other Heads of Role to drive transformation across Digital, Data and Technology, leading on strategic projects to drive this change.
* Ensuring current and future resourcing needs for user research across the Home Office are met, by upskilling, hiring new talent and allocating resources as required.
* Developing recruitment and retention strategies, establishing consistent job descriptions, skills frameworks, career pathways, learning and development plans and performance incentives.
* Defining, developing and embedding standards, guidelines and processes that promote best practice and consistent ways of working and assure quality of user research across the Home Office.
* Building an inclusive community of practice that enables User Researchers across multiple projects and business areas to share ideas, discuss best practice and proactively help and support each other.
* Line managing, supporting and mentoring user researchers and UCD Operations staff, providing them with guidance, training and constructive feedback.

You will also be expected to carry out the following day to day activities:
* Assessing Home Office services to make sure they are accessible and meet relevant government and industry standards.
* Being an active leader in the cross-government User Research community, sharing advice and best practice with Heads of User Research in other departments.
* Being a thought leader, blogging and presenting at conferences to raise the profile of user research both within and outside government.
* Creating and maintaining learning and development plans that promote a common skills framework and support career progression.
* Building capability and assuring quality through regular peer reviews and retrospectives to support strong outputs from multidisciplinary teams.

### Essential Criteria:
You’ll have a demonstrable passion for user centred design, with the following skills or extensive experience in:
* Understanding organisational strategy and objectives, aligning user research activity across multiple projects simultaneously and adapting to changing priorities.
* Advising on the application of appropriate user research methods across different life cycle phases, as well as extensive hands on experience in applying these methods.
* Establishing an effective user-centred design culture in an organisation, convincing senior management of the value of a user-centred, evidence-based approach to influence organisational strategy and priorities.
* Building and leading a community of user research specialists that work across a range of services or programmes of work, and assuring the quality of their research.
* Defining ethical research standards and practices to ensure the safeguarding and wellbeing of participants and researchers.
* Researching diverse audiences to help teams deliver accessible and inclusive digital services.

The platform is changing the way companies like Ford and Reebok carry out their day to day design work, accelerating their creativity and the product’s time to market. We’re starting to see that being highly skilled in Gravity Sketch is important for new hires in the [adidas/Yeezy](https://jobs.adidas-group.com/adidas/job/Footwear-Designer-YEEZY/719094501/?feedId=301201&utm_source=j2w) design team sitting alongside tools like Adobe’s Photoshop.

You are positive and unafraid to ask a lot of questions and a strong believer in ‘Show, don’t tell’.

We want to benefit from your experience and expertise, and need someone who can learn our context and adapt that experience accordingly to create something that’s fit for purpose while defining what UX means for us as a company.

## Who we are
At Coconut, we’re making tax simple for sole traders. We have a unique opportunity to transform the business lives of sole traders through our smart bookkeeping and tax software. But we also make managing sole traders 80% more efficient for accountants.

Coconut has built a strong community around a simpler alternative to Xero and Quickbooks.

### Description of the Business Line or Department
SG Markets is Societe Generale’s suite of B2B digital products and applications for start-ups, corporate and financial institutions.
We are the UX Design team of the Corporate & Investment Banking division. So far with our team of ~20 designers we have delivered over 100 services on the SG Markets platform over 4 years and developed one of the most advanced Design Systems in a Bank. Our mission? To lead change and make great products with a seamless user experience.
Our team structure is flat and transversal – this means that we don’t isolate ourselves in a studio, but we’re not completely dispersed either. Instead we sit openly on the trading floor collaborating with business teams, IT and each other. Our flat team structure means that every single person on the team is heard – we don’t worry about where ideas come from, we only want to find the best solutions.

### Summary of the key purposes of the role
We’re looking for a talented UX designer who we can make an impact on us, and on the products that we work on. We love diversity and we’re open to all backgrounds. As long as you can show us your passion for user experience, your skills in strategic thinking and excellent execution, we would love to have you work with us.

As an UX designer, we’d like you to be able to use research to uncover customer issues, and opportunities. You should be able to use efficient problem framing approaches to solve problems and create products with great user experience.

### Summary of responsibilities
#### What will you be doing?
You will be working on projects end to end – you’ll be in constant contact with the Business and Information Technology teams. In the projects, you’ll work on the scoping, research, ideation, prototyping and handoff stages. All with a goal of making the best and most easily usable products.
Projects range across brand new products, redesigns of existing systems, individual feature design and one off UX or UI reviews. Our work is broad – We know that corporate companies and financial products can seem intense, but in reality this only means that we constantly have to adapt our skills to new areas, which ensures that everyone here has the opportunity to work across a huge variety of financial projects, ranging from trading tools to client onboarding services.

## Profile Required

### Competencies 
* Communication skills are a must – we have lots of presentations to product owners and users who need to understand the rationale behind your proposals.
* Self-motivation. We really value people who take initiative and can be trusted to do things on their own.
* Interest in disciplines outside of pure interface design. Our design team has the opportunity to deal with product management, engineering, research, analytics and data science (to name a few), so show us what you’re passionate about outside design!

Although we try and avoid it, there’s a lot of ambiguity in design. We want to see you own problems and have a desire to make things better, even when they aren’t specifically defined.

## Why Join Us
People join for the impact they can have on us. They stay for the impact we have on them. A flatter structure offers visibility and exposure beyond that of our competitors, so you know our names, and we know yours. It's personable, human, and inspires success through passion. By encouraging open mindedness and a willingness to share ideas, we have adapted to market changes and thrived through innovation. Bringing words like “hard work” and “dedication” together with “community” and “respect” has enabled us to work collaboratively and build our future together. We call this Team Spirit and it's what makes us different. It's what makes you different.

## Business Insight
If you feel you have the required experience and qualifications, then please apply to the SG Resourcing Team, and we will manage your application. At Société Générale, we believe our people are our strength and are core to the success of our business. As such, we search for, recruit and appoint the best available person on the basis of aptitude and ability, regardless of sex, marital or civil partnership status, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins, pregnancy, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion, belief or gender reassignment.

We are Nesta, the UK’s innovation agency for social good. We design, test and scale solutions to society’s biggest problems. Our three missions are to give every child a fair start, help people live healthy lives, and create a sustainable future where the economy works for both people and the planet.

For over 20 years, we have worked to support, encourage and inspire innovation. We work in three roles: as an innovation partner working with frontline organisations to design and test new solutions, as a venture builder supporting new and early stage businesses, and as a system shaper creating the conditions for innovation.

Harnessing the rigour of science and the creativity of design, we work relentlessly to change millions of lives for the better. Find out more at [nesta.org.uk](https://www.nesta.org.uk/)

## About Collective Intelligence
Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design helps create new ways for communities to use technology to harness their insights, ideas and power to act on the problems that matter to them and create the futures they want. We know well-designed systems can help promote healthy collective action at scale, but too often technology is designed to solve the needs of individuals or large organisations.

Our mission is to design digital tools and products that allow communities to respond collectively to challenges, and that help public and voluntary sector institutions strengthen trust and collaboration with citizens.

We work with Nesta’s mission teams and external partners to help them understand where and how collective intelligence approaches can help address the problems they’re working on. We apply collective intelligence design - which brings together insights from diverse groups of people, with new sources of data (such as sensor or mobile phone data) and digital technologies (including AI) - to develop bespoke solutions to those problems. We use rigorous research methods to test, learn and evaluate each solution.

## The Role
Nesta is looking for an exceptional end-to-end digital product design lead to develop new collective intelligence solutions, advance our work on collective intelligence design, as well as influencing and mentoring others. At the heart of CI design is the ability to effectively combine crowds, data and new digital technologies to tackle complex social challenges. This is a unique opportunity to apply, shape, codify and spread an emerging area of innovation practice. The role of the CI product design lead is to draw on, apply and further develop the method of collective intelligence design, building our key resources including the [Collective Intelligence Design Playbook](https://www.nesta.org.uk/toolkit/collective-intelligence-design-playbook/) and the [Future of Minds and Machines](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/future-minds-and-machines/) report. This includes bringing together and facilitate experts from a range of disciplines across Nesta - including data science and engineering, behavioural science and participatory approaches - leading the design and prototyping of new ‘CI’ solutions for Nesta’s missions and external partners. As part of an interdisciplinary team the Lead CI designer will work with the Centre’s researchers and grantees to analyse cutting edge practice and methods, and then turn these insights into codified frameworks, processes, methods and tools for real-world application.

You will be responsible for:
* Leading the research, design, testing and delivery of CI solutions that help deliver social impact on issues from reducing household carbon emissions to tackling obesity
* Researching and identifying strategic opportunities for potential new collective intelligence solutions for Nesta’s mission areas and external clients
* Developing new product/solution concepts, drawing on a wide range of collective intelligence methods and extensive knowledge of existing solutions
* Overseeing and managing the work of CI design team members
* User experience design, including: user research, UX flows, wireframes, prototyping, testing
* Visual interface design, including branding and aesthetics
* Interaction design, including: application design, high-fidelity prototyping, human-computer interaction
* Quality assurance for all products developed by the CI Design team, and working with the Directors to oversee the portfolio of solutions.
* Product strategy and leadership, ensuring the vision and strategic goals for the product are clearly articulated and understood by all product team members
* Developing and maintaining product roadmaps, ensuring they are informed by user insights and focused on outcomes
* Documenting insights from testing and user research, synthesising and sharing results with stakeholders
* Designing and delivering CI design workshops with key target communities and for Nesta’s mission teams and external partners
* Working collaboratively with the Centre’s Principal Researcher, and wider CI networks to analyse cutting edge practice, identify where further research is needed, and develop a programme of experimentation with new methods
* Designing and delivering capability building programmes that enable colleagues and partner organisations to use and embed the principles of Collective Intelligence Design into their work.
* Leading some business development activities.

## The Person
### Essential
* Substantial experience as a digital product designer in a commercial or not-for-profit environment, working end-to-end
* An enthusiasm for, and commitment to, becoming a recognised expert and practitioner in Collective Intelligence Design, and a desire to address complex social problems
* Experience designing for complex web, mobile and/or desktop products, preferably for public/consumer audiences (rather than B2B)
* Expertise in several core design skills, including UX core skills and prototyping

As Ably enters its next stage of growth, we’re looking for talented and curious engineers to help us build and deliver the platform to power synchronized digital experiences in realtime for one billion devices every month by 2023.

Our everyday digital experiences are in the midst of a realtime revolution. Consumers expect realtime digital experiences as standard and synchronized data in realtime is business critical for many organisations. Yet, at the same time, organizations don’t have the in-house capabilities nor the time to do this efficiently at scale. That’s where Ably comes in.

We provide a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Toyota, Bloomberg, HubSpot, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale.

But we can’t rest yet. And we’d like your help.

* **Dependable by default.** Dependability is integral to our mission and technology, but being dependable starts with our people. When we care enough to take real ownership of our products and problems - all else will follow.

## About Time Out Group plc
Time Out Group is a global media and hospitality business that inspires and enables people to explore and enjoy the best of the city.

It all began in London in 1968 when Time Out helped people discover the exciting new urban cultures that had started up all over the capital. Since then, this iconic brand has consistently maintained its status as the go-to source of inspiration for both locals and visitors alike.

The Group comprises two highly synergistic business divisions: Time Out Media and Time Out Market.

Time Out Media’s digital and physical media proposition comprises websites, mobile, social media, print and live events. Across these platforms, Time Out distributes its high-quality content – written and curated by local expert journalists – around the best food, drinks, culture, art, music, theatre, travel and entertainment in 328 cities and 58 countries. The Company is monetising this global reach and its strong traffic from a desirable audience via digital and print advertising as well as e-commerce. Since its launch 50 years ago, Time Out has become a global brand that advertisers and consumers love and trust.

Time Out Market is a food and cultural market leveraging the Time Out brand to bring the best of the city under one roof: its best chefs, drinks and cultural experiences – based on the editorial curation Time Out has always been known for. The world’s first food and cultural market experience based wholly on editorial curation, Time Out Market captures decades of local knowledge, independent reviews and expert opinions. Everything that is being offered in Time Out Market must have been reviewed with four or five stars, and not one star less, by independent Time Out journalists.

The first Time Out Market opened in Lisbon in 2014 and is now Portugal’s most popular attraction with 4.1 million visitors in 2019. Following this success, five new Time Out Markets opened in North America in 2019 in Miami, New York, Boston, Montréal and Chicago, and we recently celebrated the opening of Time Out Market Dubai in April 2021. A further pipeline of other global locations includes Porto, Prague, Abu Dhabi and London.

Time Out Group has been named International Brand of the Year 2021 by Campaign – awarding bravery, editorial innovation and forward thinking. While Time Out Market won the Most Innovative Food & Beverage Concept Award at the Global RLI (Retail & Leisure International) Awards 2021.

Across both business divisions, the Group’s mission is to help people around the world go out better.  

Time Out is a dynamic, pioneering brand and so is our team.

Pragmatic, you can see how an idea will support commercial goals, as well as being feasible within the boundaries of technology. Your interest in people and customer’s lives motivate you to go out and do your own research – be that online or in-store.

You’ve got experience of multi-track discovery and delivery, and a range of agile software development methods. You’ve worked with multiple markets, different languages and scripts, and you can easily tune into the cultural differences between regions.

As an Interaction Designer, you’ll rely on user-centered design methods to craft industry-leading user experiences—from concept to execution.

Bonnet’s mission is to fight climate change by accelerating the uptake of sustainable transport. We want to become the largest and most reliable network of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the world and put ‘range anxiety’ to bed. Through software alone, we turn every public and private charging location into an accessible and simple charge point that any driver can use.

## Background
EV sales are growing 150% every year and charger installations are expanding at a similar rate. The problem today is that chargers are difficult to find, have non-intuitive payments and are confusing to use. 

Bonnet is a startup that is looking to flip the EV charging experience on its head. Backed by Tier 1 VCs and Porsche, the company is looking to bring some customer-centricity and new technologies to the EV charging sector. The app is a one-stop-shop for EV charging, allowing drivers to see, route to and pay for all types of chargers. A single Bonnet account can be used with any charging station and features such as smart route-planning and easy payments simplify the whole experience.

## Tasks
This is an opportunity to build something from the ground up. As a young and quickly-growing startup in a nascent market, we create new technologies for our customers and are looking for creative minds to join our team. It is a great way to learn about a rapidly expanding industry (wink wink Tesla) and become an expert and pioneer in a vital sector of the future. 

We will provide you with all necessary guidance for you to learn on the job in an enthusiastic and fast-paced environment. The role will provide you with very flexible working and no face time. For a company of such a size, it is a relatively senior position as you will be one of the early employees with the potential for quick career progression. You will be working directly under our CEO in a high-responsibility role, working on delivering the most user-friendly products to our customers. 

In this role you will:

* Be fully responsible for the ongoing design of Bonnet’s native iOS and Android apps
* Craft customer journeys throughout every element of their journey with Bonnet to reduce friction and improve UX
* Illustrate ideas through storyboards, process flows, etc.
* Develop product roadmap based on customer feedback and internal data
* Gathering and evaluating user requirements in collaboration with developers
* Work closely with product developers to introduce new features and maintain/improve existent features
* Create a consistent/standardised brand image to be used across all company products and materials 
* Probably many other things that we aren’t even aware of since that’s how startup life goes!

## Requirements
* Experience in designing mobile apps
* Understanding how every pixel and button contributes to the high-level picture
* Independent worker, taking ownership of own work stream and projects
* Super creative individual who can come up with ideas; borrow from other verticals and sectors
* Knowledge and industry experience of prototyping tools. We use Figma, but are open to whatever you prefer
* Comfortable with all phases of design: Empathise, Define (the problem), Ideate, Prototype, and Test
* Interest in how your work is developed, striving to understand as much as you can about front and back-end development, and see yourself as extension of the engineering team
* Working proficiency and communication skills in English

## Benefits
* Flexible work-from-home policy 
* 30 days holiday (excl. bank holidays) 
* Weekly team lunches
* Extra day off on your birthday
* Stock Options
* Health Insurance
