She has pioneered the application of learning models in measuring Agile maturity and coaching progress, and is currently interested in modelling risk and change with complexity thinking and the Cynefin framework. Liz was awarded the Gordon Pask award in 2010 for deepening existing ideas in the Agile space and “coming up with some pretty crazy ones of her own”.

		<h3>Hypothetically Coherent</h3>
		<p>We know from the Lean UX community that hypotheses can help us to create experiments, finding out what users want with real data - but if the hypothesis fails, is there sometimes more to learn?</p>
		<p>In this talk Liz introduces Cynefin, a framework for making sense of different situations and how to approach them depending on their predictability. We look at the role of complexity in human interaction in generating unexpected but important side-effects, and the difference between hypothesis / experiment and coherence / probe as ways of enabling discovery across multiple human dimensions.</p>
