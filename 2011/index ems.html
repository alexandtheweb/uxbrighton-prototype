<p class="first">The <span class="org">UX Brighton</span> team are proud
to be presenting a User Experience Conference at Brighton Dome’s Corn
Exchange.</p> <p>Whether you’re new to the field or you’re an industry
professional, UX Brighton 2011 is an opportunity to debate, cogitate and
learn about User Experience through the lense of various disciplines
stretching from anthropology to cross-channel design.</p> <p>Blending
provocative thinkers and seasoned professionals from the UK and Europe
with  speakers from Brighton’s renowned <abbr title="User
Experience">UX</abbr> community, we’re here to look at how User
Experience design is changing with the times.</p> <p>This is our second
event, after last year’s success at UX Brighton 2010.</p>

<div id="testimonials"> <h2>Reviews of 2010</h2> <p>The very first UX
Brighton last September was an incredible event that brought together a
lot of talented people. The audience was engaged, informed, and
entertaining. Rarely have I had so much fun talking to conference
participants and I learned a lot, too. Brighton is a helluva cool town!
This could well become one of the top three events in the UK - so get
your ticket NOW!</p> <h3><span class='reviewer'>Eric Reiss</span>,
Speaker at UX Brighton 2010, CEO, <span class="org">The FatDUX
Group</span></h3>

<p>UX Brighton has been a great experience. It's an intimate conference
with a great audience and atmosphere. I loved speaking there and felt
honored to be amongst a superb selection of speakers.</p> <h3><span
class='reviewer'>Jeroen van Geel</span>, Speaker at UX Brighton 2010,
Founder &amp; CEO, <span class="org">Johnny Holland</span></h3>

<p>I found the conference an interesting mix of research and <abbr
title="User Experience">UX</abbr> driven inspiration. Outside of the
interesting subject matter presentations, my key take-out (as an MD of a
design and innovation consultancy) was the energy that is currently
powering Interaction Design forward and the positive approach to both
the discipline and the market place. I will be there again this year.
Looking forward to it.</p> <h3><span class='reviewer'>Matt
Pattison</span>, Director and co-founder of <span class="org">7bn,
Insight & Strategy</span></h3>

<p>Really enjoyed the day and the wide range of topics covered. Since
then I've snuck in plenty of facts from the talks into client meetings
and it's helped to improve my <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>
skills. Ace.</p> <h3><span class='reviewer'>Ali Pettit</span>, Senior
Account Manager, <span class="org">Public Life</span></h3>

<p>The UX Brighton conference has managed, in its first year, to put
together a group of speakers worthy of a much higher ticket price. The
atmosphere created was entertaining and exciting to be in. I look
forward to the next one.</p> <h3><span class='reviewer'>Martin
Gordon</span>, Marketing Designer, <span class="org">dotDigital Group
plc</span></h3>

<p>I found UXBrighton 2010 to be both thought provoking and useful - the
speakers were insightful and I had a great time chatting with
like-minded UXers. Looking forward to 2011!</p> <h3><span
class='reviewer'>Al Power</span>, Web Development Lead, <span
class="org">Nominet UK</span></h3>

<p>This was my first <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> event and
will definitely not be my last. I took away plenty of tips that I can
apply to web writing, as well as an improved understanding of how my
audience thinks and interacts with web pages.</p> <h3><span
class='reviewer'>Helen Keevy</span>, Core Copywriting</h3>

<p>The first UX Brighton was insightful with some great speakers who
raised interesting arguments. I look forward to seeing what the next
conference has to offer.</p> <h3><span class='reviewer'>Elly
Boulboul</span>, Graphic Designer, <span class="org">Strawberry
Soup</span></h3>

<p>I found UX Brighton 2010 to be entertaining and informative - a good
combination in my book. UX Brighton is important in championing the
needs of users, something often overlooked, yet central to the success
of products we make.</p> <h3><span class='reviewer'>Phil Blume</span>,
Project Manager, <span class="org">Adaptive Technologies
Ltd.</span></h3> </div>

<h4>Connecting anthropology and User Experience: <span
class="expansion">What can we learn from the study of social behaviour
and how groups function most effectively?</span></h4> <p><a
href="http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/about-us/staff/academic/prof-robin-dunbar
/">Professor Robin Dunbar</a> is a British anthropologist who
specialises in the evolution of sociality. His work is fundamental to
User Experience design and the implications of his findings are vast
when it comes to designing social spaces.</p> <h4>What’s he known
for?</h4> <p>Robin is best known for formulating <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Dunbar's number</a>
which can be defined as: <strong>“The measurement of the cognitive limit
to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain
stable relationships.”</strong> He theorised that this was a limit of
150 individuals. The implications of this for User Experience design are
vast when it comes to designing social spaces and creating
communities.</p> <p>His principle research areas also include the
behavioural ecology of social decision-making, modelling
socio-ecological systems and their evolution, the structure and dynamics
of social networks, and the nature of social bonding.</p> <h4>The
credentials</h4> <p>He is currently <strong>Professor of Evolutionary
Anthropology and the Director of the Institute of Cognitive and

<h4>Designing cross-channel user experiences</h4> <p>50 years ago we
relied on books and people for information, then we gradually started
going to our desktop computers to look things up, now we've got iPads
and other restless, smaller, faster physical devices.</p> <p>Information
is bleeding out of the Internet and becoming ever more embedded in the
real world. The boundaries are blurring between the physical and the
digital.</p> <p>Our experiences travel across channels: we check
something out on the web, we get texts, we go to the shop, we bring the
thing home, we connect it, we get more services online. Shouldn't our
design vision reflect this behaviour too?</p> <h4>What’s he known
for?</h4> <p><a href="http://andrearesmini.com/">Andrea Resmini</a> is
President of the <a href="http://iainstitute.org/">Information
Architecture Institute</a>, he chairs the <a

test children's attitudes to different careers. Now, with this pilot
experiment, he's replaced the test with a 3D computer game. Hubert
shares his findings and gives us food for thought on the question of
whether computer games and simulation could ever realistically replace
the written test.</p> <h4>What’s he known for?</h4> <p>Hubert is a

title="2011-09-13T09:00:00">09.00</abbr> --> Cennydd Bowles</h3>
<h4>Designing the wider web</h4> <p>The dominance of the desktop browser
is over. The web is wider now. It’s time to move away from ‘device
specific thinking’ and time to transcend ‘platformism’. Now we’re
designing for contexts, displays, connectivity, and inputs by breaking
devices down into first principles. Designers should now be aiming to
create great user experiences using the truly fluid nature of the
web.</p> <h4>What’s he known for?</h4> <p><a
href="http://cennydd.co.uk/">Cennydd</a>’s book ‘Undercover User
Experience Design’ has been acclaimed as "a must have for your
bookshelf”, and his second book “Designing the wider web” is due out
this winter. He writes a popular design blog and regularly contributes
to influential publications including Pervasive IA, A List Apart, Johnny
Holland and .Net Magazine in which he promotes thoughtful, ethical
design that touches people's lives.</p> <h4>The credentials</h4>
<p>Cennydd is a <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designer with
nine years of professional experience. He often speaks at design and
technology conferences across the world, including SXSW, Future of Web
Apps, and the prestigious closing keynote at the 2011 Information
Architecture Summit. His thoughts on design have been quoted by the
Guardian, PBS, Design Week and the Abu Dhabi National.</p> <p>As an
active member of the British user experience community, he co-founded
the UX London and UXCampLondon conferences.</p> <p>He specialises in
product design, HTML prototyping, Agile <abbr title="User
Experience">UX</abbr>, and guerrilla methods within businesses with
limited adoption of design.</p> </div>
