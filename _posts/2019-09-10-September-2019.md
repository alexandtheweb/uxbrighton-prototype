## Bridging the divide – Tamsin Bishton & Charlie Peverett

12 months ago Tamsin and Charlie took on the biggest challenge of their professional lives so far. How to use digital communication to keep nurturing the passionate support base of Rewilding Britain and also persuade detractors that they have as much as anyone - perhaps even more - to gain from helping rewilding to happen in Britain? (And how on earth to devise testable and measurable approaches to persuading people to have a change of heart?)

This wasn’t just an intellectual challenge - the success or failure of Rewilding Britain’s mission rests largely on whether the idea can become widespread action across large areas of our landscape. And that activation will only come by persuading many of the people who currently oppose the idea that there’s something in it for them.

In this talk, Tamsin & Charlie will describe how shifting their thinking from existing frameworks of user engagement, ethics and values alongside user research, practical analysis of responses to language and imagery and a certain amount of “suck it and see” ad hoc development of campaign materials has helped them to develop a new content strategy for Rewilding Britain. They’ll talk about what happens when you let go of outdated “goodie vs baddie” thinking, stop listening to stories about user need and start looking at the evidence. They’ll share the hypotheses that they are now planning to test over the coming six months, outline their ideas for how they’ll use research and data to understand success or failure and seek your ideas for other ways they might measure the impact of their work.   

## Usable, Grammatical & Readable Code – Daniel van Berzon
How can software developers learn from UX and linguistics, to help make their code more readable?

Readable code is critical, but the available advice on how to write it is full of contradictory and arbitrary rules. Grammar is also full of rules; "Prescriptive" ones that are hard to follow, and "Descriptive" ones that are intuitive.

With the help of Shakespeare, Chomsky and some little green men, we will learn the dangers of prescriptive rules, and see how the online experiment at howreadable.com applies UX research principles to uncover rules for readable code.

### About Daniel
Daniel is a software developer based in Brighton, via London and Barcelona. He has worked with the web since late last century, when EJBs were a thing. After a little Physics and a lot of Ruby on Rails, he is currently taming the front end at Ocasta Studios, and researching code readability.
