## To Bot or Not to Bot: Using Dramaturgy to connect Research with Development, [Mark McElhaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-mcelhaw-805a92)
* Ever been told you have 1 day to consolidate all existing research at the start of a new project?
* Ever questioned the way research was pulled together to form the basis for a design decision?
* Ever tried to marry qualitative research with big data?

A framework is proposed that draws on dramatic theory to tackles issues like personas, combine experience research with big data and build more tailored propositions.

**dramaturgy** *noun* The theory and practice of dramatic composition.

*Mark is a Brighton based freelance Experience Consultant working in the human/digital experience across strategy, design and research. Fascinated by the way people use media to interact with each other, get things done and express themselves, his interests include media convergence, psychology… and umbrellas.*


## Too Dry; Didn’t Apply: Redesigning Behavioural Research for Practical Use, [Jerome Ribot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerome-ribot-6520976)
Jerome will discuss problems researchers experience around with access, translation and implementation of behavioural research, and offer a potential solution that would assist in its use in a design/business context.

*Jerome is the brains behind [Cognitive Lode](http://coglode.com/): A new resource by [ribot[(http://ribot.co.uk/) to help you make better products. They distill the latest behavioural economics & consumer psychology research down into helpful little brain gems. Previously he was at ribot, where he oversaw all creative output for the studio and had ultimate responsible for the quality of the ideas that they created for clients.*
