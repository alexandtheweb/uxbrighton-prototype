### Design Games

In yet another change of format, this month [Rob Phillips](http://www.rdphillips.co.uk/ "Robâ€™s portfolio website") has agreed to run a workshop covering a number of hands-on design games. These techniques help make design more accessible and fun for clients, and lead to greater creativity and a broader range of unexpected ideas.
