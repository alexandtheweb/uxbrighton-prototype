Here's what one attendee from our previous career clinic had to say:

<blockquote>&ldquo;It really helped me get a good overview of the types of companies out there and the sorts of work they do, as well as what they look for in an applicant. The careers clinic also helped me widen my idea of the types of job I should search for. Initially Iâ€™d only been on the lookout for UX researcher roles, since that was my main academic background, but after talking to people at the clinic I realised that I could also search for junior roles that incorporated design and research.&rdquo;</blockquote>
