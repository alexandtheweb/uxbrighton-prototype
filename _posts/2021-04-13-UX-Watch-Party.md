**The UX Brighton Show & Tell take over!**

Guest MC Fiona MacNeill will present a set of short films on the theme of UX using the BETA web application backyard.co. Between each video weâ€™ll have breaks for discussion, challenges and more. 

As with Show and Tell, places are limited to 12. And it's still free. **Get all the details and sign up at [this shared Google Doc]**(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r23QcNURzNlRqqaWKIo-NLP7CqErkd7bRlquoh8gZtE/edit#)

Unlike Show and Tell you do not need to bring anything to present or discuss. All you need is an open mind and a laptop or tablet capable of running the web app.



## Any questions? 

Send Fiona MacNeill a message on the UX Brighton Slack or on Twitter [@fmacneill](https://twitter.com/fmacneill).
