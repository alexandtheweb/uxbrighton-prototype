<em>âWe shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.â</em>
<br>-- Marshal McLuhan

<strong>Has UX lost its way?</strong> Itâs become a very popular term, but unfortunately itâs more often used to refer to a thing designers do, not a thing users have.

<strong>During this [one day](#schedule) conference, we aim to eschew traditional thinking and examine better ways to model and think about the world</strong>: How we can learn from many disciplines and professions, not just design or UX; Ways of thinking and working that remove current limits to innovation; Looking at tools and techniques to help us move forward; Demonstrating how the best design needs a foundation of empirical evidence and critical thinking.

The web is always changing, moving forward, re-inventing itself, however the userâs experience remains the same. 

<strong>What can we do to get better, to help us improve the UX industry and ultimately the userâs experience?</strong> We should be thinking differently, designing new tools, approaching problems in different ways. We should be re-inventing our approaches, looking to other industries for inspiration, techniques, tools, methodologies and ways to evaluate.

Please [read our attendees guide](/conference-2016-help).

## Speakers

### Jillian Wells

#### Inventing with jobs to be done

<img src="/assets/conference-2016/jillian-wells.jpg" alt="Jillian Wells" class="speaker-photo">

<div class="topic">

  <p>In the last 5 years, the popularity of personas as a research methodology has declined, whereas a new methodology, jobs-to-be-done, is gaining a lot of traction, and for good reason.</p> 
  
  <p>Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) is an efficient, flexible research methodology that can help hardware and software teams alike create innovative product and features. This talk will detail what JTBD is, the power of using JTBD, how your software team can put the methodology to practice, and what you can do to troubleshoot when using the methodology goes awry.</p> 
  
  <p>Jillian is speaking at <a href="#1205">12:25</a></p>

<div class="bio">
  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillian-wells-37242b21">Jillian</a> is a Senior Product Researcher at <a href="http://intercom.com">Intercom</a> with over 5 years of experience in user research, industrial design, and technology.</p> 

  <p>Jillian is a human-centred design enthusiast that believes a human-centred approach is the only one to take when creating a new product or service. Having worked in both the US and Europe, she has had the opportunity to apply this thinking in industrial design, UX design, and technology based projects, as well as teaching this mindset to industrial design students at California College of the Arts.</p>

### Professor Dave Snowden

#### Complexity, abstraction & abduction

<img src="/assets/conference-2016/dave-snowden.jpg" alt="Dave Snowden" class="speaker-photo">

<div class="topic">

  <p>Prof. Snowden is the creator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework">Cynefin Framework</a>, used to apply complex adaptive systems theory to social systems.  His initial work in counter terrorism for DARPA focused on weak signal detection and human terrain mapping.  Over the last decade that work has been developed and applied to radical new approaches to understanding unarticulated user needs and understanding of how to manage inherently uncertain systems.  His work applies natural science to social systems, challenging the dominant case based approach.</p>

  <p>In this presentation he will look at the limitations and opportunities for system design that arise from the complexity theory, cognitive science and anthropology.  Building on a mixture of theory and practice he will identify new methods and ways of thinking in system design and related innovative practices.  Managing for serendipity, mass decision support and distributed ethnography will all be covered in the presentation.</p>
  
  <p>Dave is speaking at <a href="#1645">4:30pm</a></p>

</div>

<div class="bio">
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Snowden">Professor Snowden</a> divides his time between two roles: founder Chief Scientific Officer of <a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/">Cognitive Edge</a> and the founder and Director of the <a href="http://cynefin.bangor.ac.uk/">Centre for Applied Complexity</a> at Bangor  University in Wales.</p>

  <p>His work is international in nature and covers government and industry looking at complex issues relating to strategy, organisational decision making and decision making. He has pioneered a science based approach to organisations drawing on anthropology, neuroscience and complex adaptive systems theory. He is a popular and passionate keynote speaker on a range of subjects, and is well known for his pragmatic cynicism and iconoclastic style. </p>

### Richard Rutter

#### Evolving a modern agency

<img src="/assets/conference-2016/richard-rutter.jpg" alt="Richard Rutter" class="speaker-photo">

<div class="topic">
  <p>As more large organisations realise the business value of user centred design, thereâs never been a better time to be a user experience agency. But with so much work on offer helping other organisations improve their practice, it can be easy to lose sight of the room for improvement in our own companies.</p>
  
  <p>In this talk, Rich will focus on the kind of attitude that a user experience agency can adopt in order not to become stale. He will discuss general principles like positivity and a willingness to try new things and discuss some specific examples.</p>
  
  <p>Richard is speaking at <a href="#1000">10am</a></p>
</div>

<div class="bio">
  <p><a href="http://clagnut.com">Richard</a> is a cofounder of digital design studio <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a>.</p>

  <p>He is a design consultant with a vast array of experience working for big and small clients including local councils, international fashion brands, global charities, and funky start-ups, all with a prime directive to make their customersâ lives that bit better. </p>

  <p>Within Clearleft, Richardâs role includes shaping the culture of the agency and ensuring it - and its people - are not just adhering to best practice, but redefining it.</p>
</div>


### Jenni Lloyd

#### What to do if you hate your career

<img src="/assets/conference-2016/jenni-lloyd.jpg" alt="Jenni Lloyd" class="speaker-photo">

<div class="topic">
  <p>A whistle-stop exploration of the point of work, the future for UX and how to find the work most likely to lead to fulfilment.</p>
  
  <p>Jenni is speaking at <a href="#1045">10:45am</a></p>
</div>

<div class="bio">
  <p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jennilloyd/">Jenni Lloyd</a> specialises in participative change for connected and creative cultures. Via her company <a href="http://www.thepurposelab.uk/">PurposeLab</a> she works on client problems as a consultant, and also brings her own ideas to life through independent projects. Her belief is that business can and should be a force for positive change in the world - and that people connected together with a meaningful purpose can make anything happen.</p>

  <p>A digital veteran, her background is in design - from interfaces for digital products, to experience design and finally into organisational design. The linking thread is human behaviour - understanding what people want and need and how that can be provided in a mutually beneficial way.</p>

  <p>Previously, Jenni was a director of the consultancy <a href="http://www.nixonmcinnes.co.uk/">NixonMcInnes</a>, a pioneer of early social media marketing which went on to specialise in transforming how major corporations, charities and government departments behave in response to the social web.</p>

  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/jennilloyd">Jenni</a> lives in and is a fierce advocate for Brighton, the city where crazy ideas can be made real. She's proud to be a trustee of Brighton's <a href="http://pavilionfoundation.org/">Royal Pavilion and Museums Foundation</a>, seeing the Pavilion as a symbol of innovation and radical ideas. As well as supporting Brighton's creative and digital business community as a board member of <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/">Wired Sussex</a>, Jenni also sits on the University of Brighton Industrial Advisory Board.
  Her purpose-led projects include co-founding the annual <a href="http://2016.meaningconference.co.uk/">Meaning Conference</a> which explores meaning in business in the 21st Century; hosting a social imagineering project called <a href="https://storify.com/jennilloyd/connecting-brighton">Connecting Brighton</a> and co-organising <a href="http://wespringforward.com/">Spring Forward</a>, an annual festival of events that support and celebrate the women working in Brighton's digital cluster.</p>

### Stef Lewandowski

#### Sketching out the future

<img src="/assets/conference-2016/stef-lewandowski.jpg" alt="Stef Lewandowski" class="speaker-photo">

<div class="topic">
  <p>The phrase âlike a startupâ is at the point in the hype cycle where it's become a little passÃ©. Agencies have been selling the idea to their clients for years. It now seems that every large company worth its salt has a startup programme of some kind, for solving their customers' problems by applying thinking from the world of tech startups and with good reason;  competitors can appear out of nowhere and grow to a large scale in ever shorter time periods â so it's in a corporation's best interests to own that disruption rather than be subject to it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, getting the tech part of a new online business off the ground isn't so hard any more. But actually finding, validating and solving a real problem that people have, and turning that solution into a business... well that's just as hard as it ever was!</p>

  <p>But can you really apply startup methods if you're not a startup? Perhaps. New methods of looking for and solving problems have emerged, at an individual skill level, all the way up to the board room table.</p>

  <p>Stef will talk about the corporate-backed company builders that have been appearing recently, independent startup studios, agencies that spawn products, and the individuals sketching with code on profitable side-projects. What role might our UX skills play when put in these contexts?</p>

### Nic Marks

#### Happiness Intelligence - understanding the X of UX

<img src="/assets/conference-2016/nic-marks.jpg" alt="Nic Marks" class="speaker-photo">

<div class="topic">

  <p>Can we design systems that facilitate profoundly better experiences for people? Systems shape us more than we realise yet we can also shape them. How can an intelligent understanding of human happiness help us design our interventions better?</p> 

  <p>Nic will draw on his experiences over the last 15 years designing metrics about peopleâs experience of life - their happiness and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>Best known for his trailblazing work on the Happy Planet Index and Five Ways to Wellbeing, Nic will also share insights from his most recent work on work itself. This has now become a tech-based start-up called Happiness Works which creates measures of employeesâ experience of work - MX if you like - through their product MoodMap.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nic_Marks">Nic Marks</a> helps organizations build happier, more productive workplaces. </p>

  <p>Described as a âStatistician with a Soulâ because of his unusual combination of âhardâ statistical skills and âsoftâ people skills, he draws on scientific evidence to show that everyone benefits when businesses take happiness seriously. Nic founded <a href="https://happinessworks.com/">Happiness Works</a>, an innovative tech-based business with offices in London and San Francisco, to be the catalyst in changing the world of work for the better.</p>

  <p>In 2010, Nic was invited to speak at the prestigious TED global conference. His <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nic_marks_the_happy_planet_index">TED talk</a> has now been watched well over a million times, and he authored one of the original three TEDbooks, entitled <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10321145-the-happiness-manifesto">âA Happiness Manifestoâ</a>.</p>

### About our conferences
They are designed to blend the worlds of the practical, the theoretical, the commercial and the academic to create new connections and highlight the foundations of designing for User Experience. We select speakers from outside the regular design conference circuit, choosing leading UX professionals alongside those from different industries and academia.

<em>"UX Brighton gets you out of old ways of thinking. The speakers are excellent and the networking superb"</em>
<br>-- Simon Johnson, UX Researcher

<em>"Loved UX Brighton the past 2 years. A place where some truly interesting issues about designing things are being discussed and an antidote to the 'here are some things I did talks' that are rarely as good."</em>
<br>-- Ash Gibson, Creative Director
