## What the event is for

The Mentorship Launch is the first in a series of events as part of the UX Brighton mentorship program. Use this event to get inspired and gain clarity on what you want to achieve from your mentor/ee relationship. Hear from a group of speakers with mentorship hints and tips to prepare you to get the most out of the program.

Attend the launch to meet other UXers broadening their horizons. This is where you can get ready for pairing up with your new mentor/ee at the next UX Brighton mentorship evening in August at the speed-matching event.

She truly enjoys mentoring, not only does she get to meet lots of wonderful people, she helps them to expand on their current knowledge, or maybe set them on a path to switch careers but she’s improved her UX practice and skillset along the way. She will talk about how you can get into mentoring, empowerment, setting boundaries and more...
