Most technology in education is not built for the modern learning experience. It’s complex, unpredictable and no two classes are ever the same. Teachers waste time on non-teaching activities and they find it difficult to collaborate with other teachers. At Firefly, we’re freeing teachers to have a greater impact on the learning experience. Firefly allows teachers to innovate and cater to each student’s needs, preparing all students for success in the future.

**How you can help**

We already have a rich legacy, we’ve won loads of awards and have earned a reputation as the easiest to use school learning tool. But we have even greater ambitions to help every student reach their full potential. We’re at a pivotal point in what we do, with big plans for our product and exciting opportunities ahead of us. We want to work with an expert in user research so that we all understand the challenges in modern education better. With your guidance, we’ll be able to make the best decisions for our product based on what matters most to schools.

*In return, you will benefit from:*

- Being able to establish the practice of User Researcher within the organisation

- Being part of a growing and thriving Product/Design organisation

*You have proven experience in the following:*

- This is a senior role so we are looking for someone with at least 4 years experience of hands on user research for products that have shipped.

- You have experience with a range of quantitative and qualitative methodologies such as ethnographic studies, usability testing, remote testing and survey design.

- You have lead product teams through a variety of different generative and evaluative projects.

- You have previously worked in an agile environment with a product, service or UX Design team.

- This role would be perfect for someone looking for their first senior role, especially if you’ve been working as part of a larger research team and ready to take a step up to lead the process yourself.

*Your first couple of months:*

- Lots of introductions with people and teams across the business where you can learn about our purpose, our product strategy, our process and our plans for the future.

- Learning about all the different ways we currently gather knowledge about our users.

- Visiting schools, getting to know what the modern learning experience is like.

- Absorbing the research that has been done so far to familiarise yourself with our users and areas of focus.

- Coaching the team in all the different research methods that they can call on to conduct research and solve problems themselves.

*Over time:*

- Carry out a variety of quantitative and qualitative studies with people from schools, both remote and in-person.

- Engage with third party research agencies to source participants.

- Helping us find a consistent way of storing our knowledge, making sure it is accessible to everyone, and where everyone can contribute.

- Working with the Design Lead and PMs to develop a research roadmap.

- Developing a toolkit of research methods, report templates and a shared vocabulary for our research practices.

**Our team**

You’ll be joining the Design team as the first UX Researcher. We’re a small team, but are respected across the whole company for our expertise and commitment to providing the best experience for our users. We work closely with the Product team, so we continually have the opportunity to guide and shape the direction of the product. We’re really passionate about design, and love to do meaningful work and get things done.

We aim to learn at every opportunity. We receive an annual training budget and use this to attend conferences, workshops, take online courses and have shelves full of books in our workspaces. We like to hang out together too–we go for dinner together regularly and do all sorts of activities with the wider Firefly team.

You can read a bit more about some of our recent design activities in our team blog https://medium.com/firefly-design and see a video of what it’s like to work at Firefly.

- We are open minded about the possibility of someone who wishes to work remotely in the UK some or even most of the time. Tell us on your application and we can talk about it with you if you are short-listed.

- Some travel will be required to meet customers and attend research sessions but much of the work we do can be done remotely in the UK.

- We understand the need for flexibility due to the nature of this job so we are happy to discuss flexible working arrangements.

### What we value

We’re a group of smart, passionate people with the support, trust and freedom to do the job we love. We’re free from the typical constraints of big agencies and have fostered a culture that encourages you to do the best and most fulfilling work of your career. There are a number of key attitudes shared by everyone at Clearleft:

**You get under the skin of problems**

You insist on a deeper understanding of the problem before rushing into solutions, even if that sometimes means starting out with ‘just enough research’. You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You think strategically**

You are a big–picture thinker but understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues and workshops are often your medium of choice. Your primary outputs are invariably physical rather than digital - such as walls full of post-it notes.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your findings and ideas with colleagues, peers and the community, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as JTBD or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

### Does this sound like you?

If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

**Some things worth noting**

- We are keeping this vacancy open until it is filled, which means there is no closing date for applications
- We endeavour to get in touch with candidates within two weeks of you contacting us, which typically begins with a casual chat prior to a more formal interview process
