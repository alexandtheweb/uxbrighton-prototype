**We've developed an amazing set of skills for empathising with our end-users, but rarely if ever do we turn these techniques in the other direction: on our clients. Just the opposite in fact: we're much more likely to talk of our clients as idiots who don't 'get it' than as understandably stressed human beings pushed outside of their comfort zone.**

**This lack of empathy seems strange given our trade, and the fact that they have by far the most influence over whether our not our projects will be successful.**

**If we can learn to handle our stakeholders more empathetically then we can make better products for our users, and help our projects to run smoothly and successfully.**

**And that's what this event is all about.** 

## Kevin O'Neill - The 7 habits of highly frustrating stakeholders

We'll kick of the evening with a talk by Kevin, a digital strategist at London Agency Centigrade. Clients come in lots of different flavours, and understanding how to handle them differently will help us to bring about successful project outcomes for our users. In this session Kevin will talk us through his taxonomy of stakeholders, and teach us how we can avoid tearing our hair out when we encounter the worst.
